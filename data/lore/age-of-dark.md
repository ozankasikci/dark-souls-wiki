# The Age of Dark

## The Inevitable End
The Age of Dark is the prophesied era that will follow the Age of Fire when the First Flame finally fades. It represents the natural conclusion of the world's cycle, long delayed by the repeated linking of the fire.

## Nature of the Dark
The Dark is intrinsically tied to humanity:
- Born from the Dark Soul found by the Furtive Pygmy
- Grows stronger as the First Flame weakens
- Represents humanity's true nature, free from the gods' influence
- Associated with the Abyss, though they are not the same

## The Prophecy
Ancient prophecies speak of the Age of Dark:
- When the fire fades, only Dark will remain
- A Dark Lord will rise to usher in the new age
- Humanity will inherit the world from the gods
- The natural order will be restored

## Perspectives on the Dark

### The Gods' View
- Gwyn and his children fear the Dark
- See it as the end of everything they built
- Will sacrifice anything to prevent its arrival
- Branded humanity with the Darksign to contain it

### The Human View
- Some see it as liberation from the gods
- Others fear the unknown it represents
- The Sable Church of Londor embraces it
- Many are simply unaware of its significance

### The Dragons' View
- The ancient dragons existed before Fire and Dark
- They may be indifferent to both ages
- Some seek to return to the Age of Ancients

## Key Figures

### Darkstalker Kaathe
- Primordial serpent who encourages the Age of Dark
- Claims it is humanity's rightful inheritance
- Opposes Frampt and the linking of the fire
- Founded the Darkwraiths to hasten the Dark

### Nashandra
- Fragment of Manus, Father of the Abyss
- Sought to usher in the Age of Dark
- Manipulated kingdoms to claim power
- Represents the Dark's corrupting influence

### Yuria of Londor
- Seeks a different path - the Usurpation of Fire
- Would see an Undead lord rule the Age of Dark
- Represents controlled transition rather than chaos

## The Abyss
While related to the Dark, the Abyss is its corrupted form:
- Created when Manus's humanity went wild
- Spreads uncontrollably, consuming everything
- Not the true Age of Dark but a perversion of it
- Cities like Oolacile and New Londo fell to it

## Consequences of the Age of Dark
What would actually happen remains uncertain:
- The world might return to its primordial state
- Humanity might finally be free of the curse
- New forms of life might emerge
- The very concepts of time and space might change

## The Choice
Throughout the series, protagonists face the choice:
- Link the Fire and extend the Age of Fire
- Let it fade and usher in the Age of Dark
- Usurp the flame for a different outcome
- Seek alternatives like Aldia did

## Fear and Misunderstanding
Much fear of the Dark stems from propaganda:
- Gwyn's legacy paints it as evil
- The Way of White preaches against it
- Most humans don't understand their connection to it
- The true Age of Dark might be different from what anyone expects

The Age of Dark remains one of the most mysterious and debated aspects of Dark Souls lore, representing both humanity's greatest fear and perhaps its ultimate destiny.
