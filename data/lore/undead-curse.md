# The Undead Curse

## Origin of the Curse
The Undead Curse began when Lord Gwyn first linked the First Flame. In his desperate attempt to extend the Age of Fire, Gwyn inadvertently cursed humanity with the Darksign, a ring of fire that brands the Undead.

## The Darksign
The Darksign is a cursed brand that:
- Appears on those afflicted with the Undead Curse
- Prevents true death, causing resurrection at bonfires
- Slowly drains humanity and souls
- Eventually leads to hollowing

## Mechanism of Undeath
When a human dies bearing the Darksign:
1. They resurrect at the last bonfire
2. Lose collected souls and humanity
3. Gradually lose their sanity and purpose
4. Eventually become hollow - mindless and aggressive

## Hollowing Process
The transformation from human to hollow involves:
- **Loss of Purpose**: Without clear goals, Undead lose their sanity
- **Memory Loss**: Gradually forget their past lives
- **Physical Decay**: The body withers and decays
- **Mental Degradation**: Eventually become mindless, attacking anything nearby

## Preventing Hollowing
Several methods can stave off hollowing:
- **Humanity**: Consuming humanity temporarily reverses hollowing
- **Purpose**: Having a clear goal or mission maintains sanity
- **Human Effigy**: Restores human appearance and vitality
- **Purging Stones**: Removes hollow appearance but not the curse

## Cultural Impact
The Undead Curse has shaped civilization:
- **Undead Asylums**: Places to contain the cursed
- **Way of White**: Religious order seeking to break the curse
- **Undead Hunts**: Systematic persecution of the afflicted
- **Pilgrimage**: Many Undead journey to Lordran seeking answers

## Connection to the Flame
The curse is intrinsically linked to the First Flame:
- Stronger when the flame is weak
- More humans become Undead as the fire fades
- Linking the fire temporarily alleviates the curse
- The curse may be Gwyn's greatest sin against humanity

## Theories and Speculation
Various theories exist about the curse's true nature:
- A seal placed by Gwyn to contain the Dark Soul
- Humanity's natural state being suppressed
- A failsafe to ensure someone will always link the fire
- The gods' method of controlling humans

## Breaking the Curse
Throughout the ages, many have sought to break the curse:
- **Vendrick**: Sought a way to overcome the curse but failed
- **Aldia**: Experimented extensively, becoming something beyond life and death
- **The Sable Church**: Embraces the curse as humanity's true nature

The curse remains one of the greatest mysteries and tragedies of the Dark Souls universe, driving countless stories of heroism, madness, and despair.
