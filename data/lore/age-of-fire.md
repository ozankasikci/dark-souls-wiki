# The Age of Fire

## Overview
The Age of Fire began when Gwyn, Lord of Sunlight, linked the First Flame to stave off the Age of Dark. This act fundamentally altered the natural order of the world.

## The First Flame
- Discovered by Gwyn and the other Lords
- Source of disparity: life/death, light/dark
- Natural cycle: meant to fade and give way to Age of Dark
- Gwyn's linking: artificial extension of the Age

## Consequences
### The Undead Curse
- Humans marked with Dark Sign
- Cannot die permanently
- Gradually lose humanity and become Hollow
- Direct result of Gwyn's linking

### The Linking Cycle
- Fire fades periodically
- Chosen Undead/Unkindled arise
- Must choose: link fire or let it fade
- Each linking weakens the flame further

## Key Figures
- **Gwyn**: First to link the flame
- **Chosen Undead**: DS1 protagonist
- **Bearer of the Curse**: DS2 protagonist
- **Ashen One**: DS3 protagonist

## The Fading
By Dark Souls 3:
- Flame barely sustained by cinders

- World converging and collapsing
