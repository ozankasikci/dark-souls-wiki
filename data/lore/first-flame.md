# The First Flame

## The Beginning
In the Age of Ancients, the world was unformed, shrouded by fog. A land of gray crags, Archtrees, and Everlasting Dragons. But then there was Fire, and with Fire came disparity. Heat and cold, life and death, and of course, light and dark.

## The Lord Souls
From the Dark, they came, and found the Souls of Lords within the flame:
- **Gwyn**, Lord of Sunlight, and his faithful knights
- **The Witch of Izalith** and her Daughters of Chaos
- **Nito**, the First of the Dead
- **The Furtive Pygmy**, so easily forgotten

## The Age of Fire
With the strength of Lords, they challenged the Dragons. Gwyn's mighty bolts peeled apart their stone scales. The Witches weaved great firestorms. Nito unleashed a miasma of death and disease. And Seath the Scaleless betrayed his own, and the Dragons were no more.

## The Fading
But the First Flame began to fade, threatening to return the world to darkness. Gwyn sacrificed himself to link the Fire, burning his very soul to extend the Age of Fire. As the flame continued to weaken over the ages, the Darksign began appearing on humans, creating the Undead. Whether the curse was a direct consequence of Gwyn's linking or simply a symptom of the fading flame remains unclear.

## The Cycle
Since Gwyn's linking, the flame has been linked countless times by various heroes:
- The Chosen Undead
- The Bearer of the Curse
- The Ashen One

Each linking weakens the flame further, requiring greater sacrifice each time.

## Nature of the Flame
The First Flame is the source of all disparity in the world:
- It created the distinction between life and death
- It brought time and causality into being
- It separates light from dark
- It gave power to the Lord Souls

## The Dark Soul
The Furtive Pygmy found the Dark Soul and split it among humanity, creating the race of humans. This Dark Soul grows stronger as the flame fades, suggesting humanity's true nature is tied to the Dark.

## Prophecies and Fate
Various prophecies speak of the flame's fate:
- The prophecy of the Chosen Undead
- The coming Age of Dark
- The rise of the Dark Lord
- The fading of the fire despite all efforts

## The Final Fading
By the time of Dark Souls III, the First Flame has been linked so many times it barely sustains itself. The world converges at the Kiln, lands colliding as time and space break down. The flame now resurrects previous Lords of Cinder, so desperate is its need for fuel.

The question remains: Should the flame be linked once more, be allowed to fade, or be usurped for a new age?
