# Greatsword

This ultragreatsword is the heaviest of the greatsword category. Too heavy for a human, perhaps it cannot be called a sword.

## Acquisition
- Found in Anor Londo
- On a corpse behind illusory wall
- Near the room with Silver Knight archers
- Can be obtained relatively early with Master Key

## Characteristics
The Greatsword is clearly inspired by Guts' Dragonslayer from Berserk manga/anime. Despite its name, it's an ultra greatsword.

**Moveset:**
- One-handed R1: Horizontal sweeps
- One-handed R2: Upward slash
- Two-handed R1: Vertical slams
- Two-handed R2: Thrust

**Special Properties:**
