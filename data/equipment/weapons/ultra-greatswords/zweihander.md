# Zweihander

The Zweihander is a massive ultra greatsword that trades speed for incredible reach and damage. A favorite among strength builds and the weapon of choice for the legendary "Giant Dad" build.

## Acquisition

Found on a corpse in the **Graveyard behind Firelink Shrine**:
- Located in front of the large tombstone at the farthest end
- To the right of the stairs leading down toward the Catacombs
- Guarded by two Skeletons and one Giant Skeleton

**Strategy**: Sprint past the skeletons, grab the weapon, and use a Homeward Bone or die to return to Firelink.

## Stats

| Stat | Value |
|------|-------|
| Physical Damage | 150 (base) |
| Weight | 10.0 |
| Durability | 200 |
| Critical | 100 |
| Strength Scaling | C |
| Dexterity Scaling | D |

## Requirements

| Stat | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| Strength | 24 (16 to two-hand) |
| Dexterity | 10 |

## Weapon Overview

The Zweihander is unique among Ultra Greatswords:
- **Lowest stat requirements** in its class
- **Lightest** ultra greatsword at 10.0 weight
- **Unique horizontal R2 attacks** (different from other UGS)
- **Exceptional reach**
- Available extremely early in the game

## Moveset

### One-Handed
- **R1**: Wide horizontal swings
- **R2**: Unique horizontal sweep
- **Rolling R1**: Upward slash
- **Running R1**: Powerful overhead slam

### Two-Handed
- **R1**: Vertical slams
- **R2**: Wide horizontal sweep

## Build Recommendations

### Pure Strength Build
At 27 STR (two-handing = effective 40 STR), the Zweihander performs excellently. Push to 40+ STR for maximum scaling.

### Quality Build (27 STR / 40 DEX)
Viable but not optimal due to the lower DEX scaling (D rank).

### Elemental Builds
At Lightning +5, Fire +10, or Chaos +5 (with 10 humanity), the Zweihander exceeds **700 AR** - one of the highest in the game:
- **Lightning +5**: Removes scaling, pure damage
- **Fire +10**: Another scaleless option
- **Chaos +5**: Scales with humanity, devastating with 10 soft humanity

## "Giant Dad" Build

The Zweihander is the centerpiece of the legendary Giant Dad PvP build:
- Giant's Armor Set
- Father Mask
- Chaos Zweihander +5
- Grass Crest Shield (on back)
- Havel's Ring + Ring of Favor and Protection
- Fast roll with massive poise

## Upgrades

Standard upgrade path using Titanite:
- +0 to +5: Titanite Shards
- +6 to +10: Large Titanite Shards
- +11 to +14: Titanite Chunks
- +15: Titanite Slab

Elemental paths available at +5 or +10 base.

## Comparison with Other Ultra Greatswords

| Weapon | Weight | STR Req | Features |
|--------|--------|---------|----------|
| Zweihander | 10.0 | 24 | Horizontal R2s, low requirements |
| Greatsword | 12.0 | 28 | Higher damage, standard moveset |
| Demon Great Machete | 13.0 | 40 | Very high base damage |
| Dragon Greatsword | 24.0 | 50 | Shockwave R2, massive damage |

## Tips

1. **Two-hand at 16 STR** to use it immediately upon acquiring
2. **Use the reach** to hit enemies before they reach you
3. **Manage stamina** carefully - each swing is costly
4. **Elemental paths** are excellent for low-level invasions
5. **Poise through attacks** - UGS attacks have high poise damage

## Notes

- One of the most popular weapons in Dark Souls history
- Trivializes early game when acquired immediately
- The "Giant Dad" build became a meme due to its effectiveness
- Excellent for both PvE and PvP
- Getting it early requires dodging dangerous skeletons
