# Priscilla's Dagger

This dagger, one of the rare dragon weapons, is formed by the tail of Crossbreed Priscilla. Its blade causes bleeding that deals 50% of the target's max HP when triggered.

## Acquisition
- Cut off Crossbreed Priscilla's tail in Painted World of Ariamis
- Automatically awarded when tail is cut (no need to pick up)
- Attacking Priscilla counts as a sin (need to absolve at Oswald)

**Strategy for tail cut:**
1. Before the fight starts, position yourself near her tail
2. Hit her TAIL (not body) as your first attack to start the fight
3. Keep swinging while she turns invisible - she won't attack immediately
4. Aim for the TIP of the tail
5. Vertical slashing weapons work best (Claymore 2H light attack)
6. Fire resin + Claymore +10 makes this easy

**Alternative method (without killing her):**
- Use Lordvessel to warp back to Painted World bonfire
- Cut tail, then use Homeward Bone
- Absolve sins at Oswald to keep her alive

## Characteristics
Priscilla's Dagger has 20 bleed buildup per strike but triggers for 50% of the target's max HP when bleed procs.

**Moveset:**
- One-handed R1: Horizontal slashes
- One-handed R2: Thrust attack
- Two-handed R1: Wide slashes
- Two-handed R2: Jumping attack

**Special Properties:**
- Bleed deals 50% of target's max HP (like Lifehunt Scythe)
- Occult auxiliary effect
- Cannot be buffed
- A scaling in Dexterity

## Upgrades
Dragon weapon, upgraded with Dragon Scales:
- Base → +1 (1 Dragon Scale)
- +1 → +2 (1 Dragon Scale)
- +2 → +3 (2 Dragon Scales)
- +3 → +4 (2 Dragon Scales)
- +4 → +5 (4 Dragon Scales)

At +5 with 40 DEX: ~269 damage

## Notes
- Bleed damage is percentage-based (devastating vs high HP targets)
- A scaling makes it excellent for DEX builds
- Popular for bleed-focused PvP builds
- Requires entering optional Painted World area
- Can get dagger without killing Priscilla
