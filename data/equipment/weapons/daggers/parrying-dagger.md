# Parrying Dagger

A dagger with a greatly curved guard. Used for parrying attacks. It is specialized for parrying, and its attack power is low. Not intended for use in attack.

## Acquisition
- Found in New Londo Ruins on a corpse near the entrance (requires draining water)
- Sold by Shiva of the East in Blighttown for 2,000 souls (requires Forest Hunter covenant)

## Characteristics
The Parrying Dagger has an extended parry window compared to other daggers, making it easier to successfully parry enemy attacks. While its damage is slightly lower than the regular dagger, it shares the same critical modifier.

**Moveset:**
- One-handed R1: Quick slashes
- One-handed R2: Forward thrust
- One-handed L2: Extended parry animation
- Two-handed R1: Diagonal slashes

**Parry Frames:**
- Start-up: 8 frames
- Active parry window: 12 frames (compared to 8 for most weapons)
- Recovery: 18 frames

## Upgrades
While you can upgrade the Parrying Dagger along any path, most players keep it at base level since it's primarily used for parrying:
- **Normal +15**: If you want to use it offensively
- **Raw +5**: Quick damage boost without stat investment
- Most players don't upgrade it at all

## Notes
- Popular off-hand weapon for PvP parrying
- Extended parry window makes it forgiving for learning to parry
- Low weight allows it to fit in any build
- Often paired with a high-damage main weapon for riposte damage
- Cannot parry while two-handing
