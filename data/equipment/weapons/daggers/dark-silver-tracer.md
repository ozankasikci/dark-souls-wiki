# Dark Silver Tracer

A dark silver dagger used by the Lord's Blade Ciaran, one of Gwyn's Four Knights. The victim is said to suffer from syndrome of the "dance of death" and pricks of a thousand needles.

## Acquisition
- Given by Lord's Blade Ciaran in exchange for Soul of Artorias (Artorias of the Abyss DLC)
- Dropped by Ciaran if killed (along with Gold Tracer)
- Ciaran appears after defeating Artorias, near his boss arena

## Characteristics
The Dark Silver Tracer has the highest critical modifier of any weapon at 160, surpassing even the Bandit's Knife. It also features S-scaling in dexterity when fully upgraded, making it devastating in the hands of a DEX build.

**Moveset:**
- One-handed R1: Quick slashes with unique animations
- One-handed R2: Thrust followed by upward slash
- Two-handed R1: Wide horizontal slashes
- Two-handed R2: Leaping thrust

**Special Properties:**
- 160 critical modifier (highest in game)
- Unique R2 combo attacks
- Cannot be buffed

- Dark Silver Tracer → +1 (1 Twinkling Titanite)
- +1 → +2 (1 Twinkling Titanite)  
- +2 → +3 (2 Twinkling Titanite)
- +3 → +4 (2 Twinkling Titanite)
- +4 → +5 (4 Twinkling Titanite)

At +5: 150 physical damage, S dexterity scaling
