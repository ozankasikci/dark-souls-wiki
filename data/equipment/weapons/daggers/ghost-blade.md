# Ghost Blade

A cursed blade that can damage ghosts without the wielder being cursed. One of the special cursed weapons scattered throughout New Londo.

## Acquisition
- Rare drop from Ghosts in New Londo Ruins (1% drop rate)
- Can be farmed from the ghosts near the wooden bridges

## Characteristics
The Ghost Blade is unique among daggers as it can damage ghosts without requiring the player to be cursed or use a Transient Curse. While its critical modifier is lower than the standard dagger, it has significantly higher base damage.

**Moveset:**
- Similar to regular dagger moveset
- One-handed R1: Quick slashes
- One-handed R2: Forward thrust
- Two-handed R1: Diagonal slashes
- Two-handed R2: Jumping attack

## Upgrades
As a special weapon, the Ghost Blade can only be upgraded using Twinkling Titanite:
- Ghost Blade → Ghost Blade +1 (1 Twinkling Titanite)
- Ghost Blade +1 → Ghost Blade +2 (1 Twinkling Titanite)
- Ghost Blade +2 → Ghost Blade +3 (2 Twinkling Titanite)
- Ghost Blade +3 → Ghost Blade +4 (2 Twinkling Titanite)
- Ghost Blade +4 → Ghost Blade +5 (4 Twinkling Titanite)

## Notes
- Essential for early New Londo exploration without using Transient Curses
- Cannot be buffed with resins or spells
- Low durability requires careful use
- One of only two weapons that can hit ghosts without curse (along with Jagged Ghost Blade)
