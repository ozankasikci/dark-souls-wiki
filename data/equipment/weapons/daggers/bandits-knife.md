# Bandit's Knife

This wide single-edged shortsword is the favorite of lowly thieves and bandits. Primarily a slashing weapon, but highly effective when used for critical hits, such as after parrying or from behind.

## Acquisition
- Starting equipment for the Thief class
- Dropped by Undead Assassins in Lower Undead Burg (2% drop rate)
- Can be farmed from the hollow thieves near the Capra Demon fog gate

## Characteristics
The Bandit's Knife boasts the highest critical modifier in the game at 147, making it the ultimate weapon for backstabs and ripostes. Additionally, it causes bleed buildup, making it effective against enemies susceptible to bleeding.

**Moveset:**
- One-handed R1: Horizontal slashes
- One-handed R2: Thrust attack
- Two-handed R1: Diagonal slashes
- Two-handed R2: Jumping slash

## Upgrades
The Bandit's Knife maintains its bleed effect on most upgrade paths:
- **Normal +15**: Best for DEX builds, maintains bleed
- **Crystal +5**: Highest damage but loses bleed effect
- **Chaos +5**: Good damage with low stats, keeps bleed
- **Lightning +5**: High damage, loses bleed effect

## Notes
- Most popular dagger for PvP due to bleed and critical damage
- Bleed buildup is 36 per hit (300 total bleed meter)
- Slightly heavier than regular dagger but worth it for the benefits
- Often paired with Hornet Ring for maximum critical damage
