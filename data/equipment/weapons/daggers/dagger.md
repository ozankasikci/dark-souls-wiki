# Dagger

A standard dagger. Small, lightweight, and easy to handle. It has a short reach, but attacks quickly, allowing for an effective barrage. The blade is thin and sharp, making it ideal for critical attacks.

## Acquisition
- Starting equipment for the Sorcerer class
- Purchased from the Undead Male Merchant in Undead Burg for 300 souls
- Found on corpses throughout Lordran

## Characteristics
The Dagger is one of the fastest weapons in Dark Souls, with very low stamina consumption per swing. While its damage output is low for regular attacks, it excels at critical attacks (backstabs and ripostes) due to its 131 critical modifier.

**Moveset:**
- One-handed R1: Quick horizontal slashes
- One-handed R2: Forward thrust
- Two-handed R1: Diagonal slashes
- Two-handed R2: Guard-breaking kick

## Upgrades
The Dagger can be upgraded along any path, making it versatile for different builds:
- **Normal +15**: Best for DEX builds
- **Crystal +5**: Maximum damage but cannot be repaired
- **Chaos +5**: Good for low stat investment builds
- **Enchanted +5**: Best for INT builds

## Notes
- Popular choice for backstab-focused builds
- Often used as a secondary weapon for critical attacks
- The Bandit's Knife is generally preferred for bleed builds
- Can be buffed with resins and spells when on normal upgrade path
