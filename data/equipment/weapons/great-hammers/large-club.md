# Large Club

## Overview
The Large Club is the poisonous cousin of the Great Club, trading some raw damage for the ability to inflict poison. Found in the toxic swamps of Blighttown, it's fitting that this weapon carries the blight with every swing.

## Characteristics

### Advantages
- **Poison Effect**: 180 poison buildup
- **A-Rank Scaling**: Excellent strength scaling
- **Lower Requirements**: 26 STR vs 28
- **Lighter Weight**: 11.0 vs 12.0 units
- **High Durability**: 600 points

### Disadvantages
- **Lower Base Damage**: 120 vs 135
- **Must Farm**: Not guaranteed drop
- **Dangerous Farm Location**: Blighttown barbarians
- **Less Total Damage**: Than Great Club at +15

## Location
Dropped by **Infested Barbarians** in Blighttown:
- Large club-wielding enemies
- Found in upper Blighttown
- Also in the swamp area
- Low drop rate (farm with humanity)
- Dangerous enemies to fight

## Best Practices

### Builds
The Large Club excels in:
- Poison-focused strength builds
- Status effect builds
- Mid-level strength characters
- Blighttown invasion builds

### Upgrade Paths
- **Standard +15**: Keeps poison, maximizes damage
- **Crystal +5**: Maximum damage, loses repair
- **Lightning/Fire**: Removes poison effect
- **Raw**: Not recommended due to good scaling

### Combat Tips
1. Poison adds pressure in prolonged fights
2. Two-hand for maximum effectiveness
3. Combine with Dung Pies for toxic
4. Works well in poison-themed builds

## Poison Mechanics
- 180 poison per hit
- Most enemies have 180-240 resistance
- Poison deals damage over time
- Stacks with environmental poison
- Forces healing in PvP

## Farming Strategy
Best farming approach:
1. Equip Covetous Gold Serpent Ring
2. Use 10 humanity
3. Farm from Blighttown bonfire
4. Kill 2-3 barbarians per run
5. Reset at bonfire

## Comparison to Other Weapons
- **vs Great Club**: Less damage, has poison
- **vs Reinforced Club**: Much stronger, same concept
- **vs Other Great Hammers**: Only one with status
- **Unique Niche**: Poison great hammer

## Build Synergies
Works well with:
- Poison Mist pyromancy
- Toxic Mist pyromancy
- Poison throwing knives
- Shadow armor set (poison resist)

## PvP Applications
- Poison pressure in invasions
- Psychological effect of poison bar
- Forces estus usage
- Good for attrition fights

## Environmental Advantages
In Blighttown:
- Enemies already poisoned
- Your poison stacks with swamp
- Thematically appropriate
- Home field advantage

## Notes
- Popular for poison-only challenge runs
- The moss texture is unique
- Can poison bosses like Sif
- Represents Blighttown's influence
