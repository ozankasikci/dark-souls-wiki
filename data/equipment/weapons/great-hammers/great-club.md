# Great Club

## Overview
The Great Club is the epitome of brute force in Dark Souls. This massive wooden weapon boasts some of the highest physical damage in the game, combined with exceptional strength scaling that makes it a powerhouse for dedicated strength builds.

## Characteristics

### Advantages
- **A-Rank STR Scaling**: From base to +15
- **Massive Damage**: Among the highest in the game
- **Incredible Poise Damage**: Staggers almost anything
- **High Durability**: 600 points lasts forever
- **Free Acquisition**: Found in Blighttown

### Disadvantages
- **Very Heavy**: 12.0 weight units
- **Slow Attack Speed**: Leaves you vulnerable
- **High Requirements**: 28 STR to one-hand
- **Limited Moveset**: Basic but effective

## Location
Found in **Blighttown** swamp:
- Near the swamp bonfire area
- Look for a large tree root path
- The club is on a corpse
- Bring poison resistance for easier retrieval

## Best Practices

### Builds
The Great Club dominates in:
- Pure STR builds (50+ STR recommended)
- Poise-tank builds with heavy armor
- Strength/Endurance focused characters
- Two-handed powerhouse builds

### Upgrade Paths
- **Standard +15**: Maximizes A-scaling for massive damage
- **Crystal +5**: Highest possible damage output
- **Lightning/Fire**: Good for low-stat builds
- **Never Enchanted/Magic**: Ruins the scaling

### Combat Tips
1. Two-hand for maximum damage
2. Time attacks carefully due to slow speed
3. Running R1 covers good distance
4. R2 attacks can hit multiple enemies
5. Stunlocks most enemies completely
