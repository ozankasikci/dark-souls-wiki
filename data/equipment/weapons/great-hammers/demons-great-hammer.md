# Demon's Great Hammer

## Overview
The Demon's Great Hammer is a colossal weapon forged from the soul of the Demon Firesage. This prehistoric hammer predates the Age of Fire itself, carrying devastating power that demands immense strength to wield.

## Characteristics

### Advantages
- **Highest Base Damage**: 138 physical unupgraded
- **Can Be Buffed**: Unlike many boss weapons
- **Massive Reach**: Enormous hitbox
- **Special Shockwave**: R2 has unique property
- **High Stability**: 44 when blocking

### Disadvantages
- **Extremely Heavy**: 22.0 weight units
- **Massive Requirements**: 46 STR needed
- **Only B Scaling**: Despite STR requirements
- **Limited Upgrade**: Only to +5

## Location
Created through boss soul transposition:
1. Obtain **Demon's Catalyst** (any +10 catalyst)
2. Acquire **Soul of Demon Firesage**
3. Visit **Giant Blacksmith** in Anor Londo
4. Pay 5,000 souls for transformation
5. Cannot be reverted

## Best Practices

### Builds
The Demon's Great Hammer requires:
- **Minimum 46 STR**: Among highest in game
- **High Endurance**: To swing and maintain equip load
- **Giant Dad Builds**: Popular meme build choice
- **NG+ Builds**: Where stats are less restrictive

### Upgrade Path
- **Boss Weapon +5**: Only upgrade path
- **Buffable**: Crystal Magic Weapon devastating
- **Resins**: Work for additional damage
- **No Infusions**: Cannot change damage type

### Combat Tips
1. Two-hand to reduce STR to 31
2. R2 shockwave hits through walls
3. Incredible poise damage
4. One-shot potential on many enemies

## The Shockwave Effect
Strong attack special property:
- Creates small AoE on impact
- Can hit multiple enemies
- Goes through some obstacles
- Unique among great hammers
- Additional stagger chance

## Stat Investment Reality
At 46 STR requirement:
- Most builds stop at 40-50 STR
- B-scaling limits growth
- Often outperformed by A-scaling weapons
- Style over optimization

## Comparison to Other Great Hammers
- **vs Great Club**: Higher requirements, less scaling
- **vs Dragon Tooth**: More damage, less utility
- **vs Smough's Hammer**: Lighter, buffable
- **Trophy Weapon**: More prestige than practical

## PvP Considerations
- Intimidation factor is high
- Shockwave catches rolls
- Massive stamina drain on block
- Dead angles are devastating
- Weight limits build options

## Fashion Souls
Pairs well with:
- Demon's armor sets
- Giant's armor
- Smough's armor
- Maximum intimidation builds

## Boss Soul Decision
Demon Firesage's soul can make:
- **Demon's Great Hammer**: STR builds
- **Demon's Catalyst**: INT builds
Choose based on build direction

## Notes
- The shockwave can activate switches
- Popular in "bonk" compilation videos
- Represents pre-Fire Age craftsmanship
- The weight alone tells a story
