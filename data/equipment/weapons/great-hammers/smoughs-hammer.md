# Smough's Hammer

## Overview
Smough's Hammer is the ultimate expression of raw physical power in Dark Souls. This grotesquely massive hammer belonged to the cannibalistic executioner Smough and holds the distinction of having both the highest physical damage and weight of any weapon.

## Characteristics

### Advantages
- **Highest Physical Damage**: 300 base, 450 at +5
- **Absolute Unit**: Largest weapon model
- **Unmatched Intimidation**: Size alone wins fights
- **Pancake Machine**: Flattens everything
- **Status Symbol**: Ultimate strength flex

### Disadvantages
- **Heaviest Weapon**: 28.0 weight units
- **Highest Requirements**: 58 STR needed
- **Terrible Scaling**: Only D-rank
- **Cannot Be Buffed**: Pure physical only
- **Requires Boss Soul**: One per playthrough

## Location
Created through boss soul transposition:
1. Obtain any **+10 Hammer or Great Hammer**
2. Acquire **Soul of Smough**
3. Visit **Giant Blacksmith** in Anor Londo
4. Pay 5,000 souls for transformation
5. Prepare for the weight

## Best Practices

### Builds
Smough's Hammer demands:
- **58 STR Minimum**: Highest in the game
- **Maximum Endurance**: For weight management
- **Havel's Ring**: Almost mandatory
- **Ring of Favor**: For extra equip load
- **NG+ Recommended**: Stats are extreme

### The Weight Problem
At 28.0 units:
- Requires 56+ equip load for mid-roll
- 93+ for fast roll (impossible for most)
- Often forces fat roll builds
- Armor choices severely limited

### Combat Tips
1. Two-hand for 39 STR requirement
2. Embrace the fat roll life
3. Trade hits with poise
4. One-shot potential is real
5. Jump attacks are nuclear

## Meme Status
"The Wall" build:
- Smough's Hammer
- Smough's Armor
- Maximum poise
- Fat roll only
- Become unstoppable

## Damage Reality
Despite 300/450 damage:
- D-scaling limits growth
- Often outperformed by A-scaling weapons
- Style over substance
- The fear factor is worth it

## Comparison to Other Weapons
- **vs All Others**: Highest physical damage
- **vs Dragon Tooth**: More damage, much heavier
- **vs Great Club**: Double weight, less scaling
- **Trophy Weapon**: Peak of collection

## PvP Psychology
- Opponents panic at the size
- Sound effects are demoralizing  
- Getting hit once ends fights
- The ultimate disrespect weapon
- Fashion statement of dominance

## Practical Applications
Actually effective for:
- Strength-stacking builds
- Poise-monster setups
- One-shot compilations
- Intimidation tactics
- Meme builds

## The Smough Decision
Soul of Smough can make:
- **Smough's Hammer**: Ultimate bonk
- **Nothing Else**: This is the only option
Choose the hammer. Always the hammer.

## Cultural Impact
- Featured in countless memes
- "You Died" compilation staple
- Represents excess in weapon form
- The bonk to end all bonks

## Notes
- Can hit enemies through some walls due to size
- The R2 has a larger hitbox than the model suggests
- Required stats can be reached around SL100
- Seeing this in PvP triggers fight-or-flight response
