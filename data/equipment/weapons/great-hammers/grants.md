# Grant

## Overview
Grant is the legendary great hammer of the Way of White clerics, requiring both immense strength and deep faith to wield. This mystical weapon channels divine power through its strikes and can even cast miracles through its strong attacks.

## Characteristics

### Advantages
- **Dual Damage**: 130 physical + 130 magic
- **A-Rank Faith Scaling**: Excellent for faith builds
- **Built-in Miracle**: Two-handed R2 casts Emit Force
- **High Total AR**: 260 split damage base
- **Divine Property**: Prevents skeleton resurrection

### Disadvantages
- **Highest Requirements**: 50 STR / 30 FAI
- **Extremely Heavy**: 24.0 weight units
- **Split Damage**: Reduced by two defenses
- **Cannot Be Buffed**: No resins or spells
- **Limited Upgrade**: Only to +5

## Location
Found in **Tomb of the Giants**:
- Near the first bonfire
- Paladin Leeroy invasion location
- On a corpse near the cliff edge
- Requires careful navigation in darkness
- Can be obtained before Nito

## Best Practices

### Builds
Grant demands specific builds:
- **STR/FAI Hybrids**: 50/30 minimum stats
- **Paladin Builds**: The ultimate cleric weapon
- **NG+ Characters**: Where stats allow
- **High Level PvP**: 120+ builds

### Special Ability
Two-handed strong attack:
- Casts Emit Force miracle
- No FP/spell uses required
- Medium range projectile
- Knocks back enemies
- Goes through walls

### Combat Tips
1. Two-hand reduces STR requirement to 34
2. R2 miracle surprises opponents
3. Magic damage bypasses shields partially
4. Divine property trivializes Catacombs

## The Stat Wall
50 STR / 30 FAI means:
- Level 80+ for most builds
- Requires careful stat planning
- Often a journey's end weapon
- True dedication to the build

## Damage Calculation
- 130 physical vs physical defense
- 130 magic vs magic defense
- Both A-scaling (FAI) and B-scaling (STR)
- Often lower than expected due to split

## Comparison to Divine Weapons
- **vs Divine Claymore +10**: Grant has higher AR
- **vs Other Divine Weapons**: Only one with miracle
- **Unique Properties**: Combines weapon and catalyst
- **Prestige Factor**: Ultimate faith weapon

## Lore Significance
- Weapon of Way of White legends
- Possibly used by Allfather Lloyd
- Represents church's martial power
- Leeroy died seeking it

## PvP Applications
- Emit Force through walls
- Unexpected projectile option
- Massive poise damage
- Faith build intimidation
- Dead angles with huge hitbox

## PvE Advantages
- Trivializes Catacombs/Tomb
- Emit Force for range pulling
- Effective against demons
- One weapon for multiple situations

## Fashion Souls
Perfect with:
- Paladin armor set
- Elite Knight set
- Cleric starting gear
- Any church-themed fashion

## Notes
- The R2 miracle has no stat scaling
- Can Emit Force without meeting FAI requirement when two-handed
- Represents the pinnacle of faith weapons
- Often called "God's Hammer" by the community
