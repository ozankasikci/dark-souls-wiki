# Longsword

The Longsword is one of the most reliable and versatile weapons in Dark Souls III. Its balanced moveset, moderate stat requirements, and solid scaling make it an excellent choice for both beginners and experienced players.

## Moveset

The Longsword features a well-rounded moveset with both slashing and thrusting attacks:

- **One-handed R1**: Horizontal slashes
- **One-handed R2**: Upward thrust
- **Two-handed R1**: Vertical slashes
- **Two-handed R2**: Strong thrust with good reach

## Build Recommendations

### Quality Build
With C/C scaling in STR/DEX, the Longsword excels in quality builds (40 STR/40 DEX). At +10 with refined infusion, it reaches impressive damage output while maintaining its versatile moveset.

### Elemental Builds
The Longsword also performs well with elemental infusions:
- **Lightning**: Good for faith builds
- **Crystal**: Excellent for sorcery builds
- **Dark/Chaos**: Strong options for pyromancers

## PvP Considerations

In PvP, the Longsword's main advantages are:
- Fast startup on R1 attacks
- Good roll-catching potential
- Reliable weapon art (Stance) for breaking guards
- Low stamina consumption
