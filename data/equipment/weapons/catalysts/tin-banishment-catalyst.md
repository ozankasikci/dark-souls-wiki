# Tin Banishment Catalyst

## Overview
The Tin Banishment Catalyst is Dark Souls' joke catalyst - featuring the worst magic adjustment in the game but surprisingly high physical damage. It's better used as a strength weapon than for casting sorceries.

## Characteristics

### Advantages
- **Highest Physical**: 145 base damage
- **STR Scaling**: C at +15
- **Decent Durability**: 160
- **Meme Potential**: Comedy value
- **Unique Playstyle**: Bonk mage

### Disadvantages
- **Worst Magic Adjust**: 90-170 only
- **Heavy Weight**: 3.0 units
- **Poor Sorcery**: Terrible caster
- **Confusing Purpose**: Identity crisis
- **Not Viable**: For casting

## Location
Crestfallen Merchant:
- **Sen's Fortress**: Upper area
- **Must Kill**: Not for sale
- **One Drop**: Per playthrough
- **Murderer Required**: Dark path

## Best Practices

### The Bonk Build
How to use:
- Ignore the sorcery aspect
- Two-hand for STR bonus
- Use as melee weapon
- 362 AR at +15
- Comedy gold

### Meme Applications
Perfect for:
- STR/INT confusion
- Bonk wizard builds
- PvP mind games
- Fashion statements
- Youtube content

### Combat Tips
1. R1 for damage
2. Never cast with it
3. STR scaling focus
4. Upgrade for bonk
5. Embrace the meme

## Physical Damage Focus
At +15 with 40 STR:
- 362 base damage
- C-scaling boost
- Respectable AR
- Catalyst confusion
- Opponent surprise

## Comparison
- **vs Sorcerer's**: Garbage for magic
- **vs Clubs**: Weird catalyst club
- **For Sorcery**: Worst possible
- **For Bonking**: Surprisingly okay

## The Magic Adjust Disaster
90-170 means:
- Soul Arrow pathetic
- Any spell weak
- Utility spells sad
- Complete failure
- Don't cast

## Fashion and Confusion
Visual impact:
- Looks like catalyst
- Hits like hammer
- Confuses invaders
- Unique aesthetic
- Conversation piece

## PvP Trolling
Mind games:
- Equip catalyst
- Enemies expect magic
- Bonk them instead
- Mental damage real
- Worth the setup

## Crestfallen Merchant
Getting it requires:
- Find upper Sen's
- Kill the merchant
- Feel slightly bad
- One chance only
- Murder hobo life

## Build Reality Check
Truth about TBC:
- Not viable really
- Meme weapon only
- Fun over function
- Unique experience
- Not optimal

## The STR/INT Paradox
Weird requirements:
- Needs INT to equip
- Scales with STR
- Defeats purpose
- Identity crisis
- Fromsoft humor

## Upgrade Investment
Worth it only if:
- Committed to meme
- Want unique build
- PvP trolling focus
- Content creation
- Fun priority

## Catalyst Collection
For completionists:
- Unique drop
- One per playthrough
- Kill requirement
- Trophy hunting
- Full set goal

## Actual Use Cases
Realistically for:
- Challenge runs
- Themed builds
- Comedy value
- Collection only
- Never serious

## Notes
- The meme catalyst
- Better as a club
- Worst magic adjust ever
- Fromsoft's joke weapon
