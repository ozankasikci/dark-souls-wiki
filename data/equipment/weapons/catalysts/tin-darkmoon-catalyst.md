# Tin Darkmoon Catalyst

## Overview
The Tin Darkmoon Catalyst is unique as the only catalyst that scales sorcery damage with **Faith instead of Intelligence**. This allows Faith builds to cast sorceries effectively. Note: The 16 INT requirement is only to meet spell casting minimums, not for damage scaling.

## Characteristics

### Advantages
- **Faith Scaling**: A-rank Faith scaling for sorcery damage
- **Unique Niche**: Allows Faith builds to cast sorceries
- **Good Magic Adjust**: 217 at 50 Faith
- **Gwyndolin's Power**: Lore significant
- **No Downside**: Full spell casts (unlike Tin Crystallization)

### Disadvantages
- **16 INT Required**: Must meet sorcery cast requirements
- **16 FAI Required**: Base Faith requirement
- **Boss Soul Cost**: Requires Soul of Gwyndolin
- **Late Game**: Anor Londo+
- **Pure INT builds should use Logan's**: This is for Faith builds

## Location
Giant Blacksmith in Anor Londo:
1. Kill Dark Sun Gwyndolin
2. Obtain Soul of Gwyndolin
3. Bring any catalyst to Giant Blacksmith
4. Create for 5,000 souls
5. Note: NOT a Snuggly trade

## Best Practices

### Faith Sorcerer Excellence
Optimal stats:
- 50 FAI for maximum Magic Adjust (217)
- 16 INT minimum to cast sorceries
- Pure INT builds should use Logan's Catalyst instead
- Perfect for Faith builds wanting Dark Bead/sorcery utility

### Build Synergy
Perfect for:
- Faith builds wanting sorcery access
- Darkmoon covenant roleplay
- Dark Bead on Faith builds
- Hybrid Faith/INT builds
- Lore-appropriate builds

### Combat Tips
1. Maximize both stats
2. Standard sorceries only
3. Switch for miracles
4. Unique advantage
5. Rare optimization

## The Dual Scaling Math
With 40/40:
- Both A-rank scaling
- 293 magic adjust
- Highest possible
- Massive investment
- Unique payoff

## Comparison
- **vs Logan's**: Needs more stats
- **vs TCC**: No spell halving
- **vs Sorcerer's**: Much higher ceiling
- **Role**: Hybrid specialist

## Gwyndolin Connection
Lore importance:
- Dark Sun's catalyst
- Moon sorcery link
- Darkmoon covenant
- Gender ambiguity
- Divine intelligence

## Build Requirements
To optimize:
- 80 total levels (40/40)
- High SL needed
- NG+ viable
- PvP challenging
- Dedicated build

## Fashion Souls
Darkmoon aesthetic:
- Crescent design
- Silver/blue colors
- Gwyndolin's style
- Covenant match
- Unique appearance

## PvP Considerations
For high SL:
- Stat investment heavy
- Versatile caster
- Surprise factor
- Not meta level
- Unique builds

## The Stat Problem
Reality check:
- 80 levels for 40/40
- Sacrifices elsewhere
- High SL only
- Not efficient
- Style choice

## Upgrade Path
Boss soul weapon:
- Twinkling titanite
- Only to +5
- Expensive upgrade
- Quick progression
- Worth it if committed

## Why Use This?
Reasons:
- Unique build identity
- Lore appropriate
- Maximum magic adjust
- Versatility potential
- Different experience

## Covenant Synergy
Darkmoon builds:
- Thematic fit
- Gwyndolin loyalty
- Blue aesthetic
- Role-playing value
- Complete package

## Trading Decision
Soul of Gwyndolin:
- This catalyst
- Darkmoon Bow
- 20000 souls
- One choice only
- Plan ahead

## Notes
- The hybrid catalyst
- Unique dual scaling
- High investment needed
- For dedicated builds only
