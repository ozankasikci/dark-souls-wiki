# Tin Darkmoon Catalyst

## Overview
The Tin Darkmoon Catalyst stands unique as the only catalyst that scales with both Intelligence and Faith, created from Gwyndolin's soul. It rewards hybrid builds with potentially the highest magic adjustment.

## Characteristics

### Advantages
- **Dual Scaling**: INT and FAI both A
- **Highest Potential**: 293 at +5
- **Unique Niche**: INT/FAI builds
- **Gwyndolin's Power**: Lore significant
- **No Downside**: Full spell casts

### Disadvantages
- **16/16 Requirements**: Dual stats
- **Niche Build**: Limited use
- **Boss Soul Cost**: Gwyndolin sacrifice
- **Split Investment**: Stats spread
- **Late Game**: Anor Londo+

## Location
Snuggly trade:
1. Kill Dark Sun Gwyndolin
2. Obtain his soul
3. Return to Asylum
4. Trade with crow
5. Receive catalyst

## Best Practices

### Hybrid Excellence
Optimal stats:
- 40 INT / 40 FAI ideal
- 30/30 minimum viable
- Pure builds avoid
- Unique stat spread
- Maximum potential

### Build Synergy
Perfect for:
- Darkmoon builds
- INT/FAI hybrids
- Versatile casters
- Lore builds
- Unique playstyles

### Combat Tips
1. Maximize both stats
2. Standard sorceries only
3. Switch for miracles
4. Unique advantage
5. Rare optimization

## The Dual Scaling Math
With 40/40:
- Both A-rank scaling
- 293 magic adjust
- Highest possible
- Massive investment
- Unique payoff

## Comparison
- **vs Logan's**: Needs more stats
- **vs TCC**: No spell halving
- **vs Sorcerer's**: Much higher ceiling
- **Role**: Hybrid specialist

## Gwyndolin Connection
Lore importance:
- Dark Sun's catalyst
- Moon sorcery link
- Darkmoon covenant
- Gender ambiguity
- Divine intelligence

## Build Requirements
To optimize:
- 80 total levels (40/40)
- High SL needed
- NG+ viable
- PvP challenging
- Dedicated build

## Fashion Souls
Darkmoon aesthetic:
- Crescent design
- Silver/blue colors
- Gwyndolin's style
- Covenant match
- Unique appearance

## PvP Considerations
For high SL:
- Stat investment heavy
- Versatile caster
- Surprise factor
- Not meta level
- Unique builds

## The Stat Problem
Reality check:
- 80 levels for 40/40
- Sacrifices elsewhere
- High SL only
- Not efficient
- Style choice

## Upgrade Path
Boss soul weapon:
- Twinkling titanite
- Only to +5
- Expensive upgrade
- Quick progression
- Worth it if committed

## Why Use This?
Reasons:
- Unique build identity
- Lore appropriate
- Maximum magic adjust
- Versatility potential
- Different experience

## Covenant Synergy
Darkmoon builds:
- Thematic fit
- Gwyndolin loyalty
- Blue aesthetic
- Role-playing value
- Complete package

## Trading Decision
Soul of Gwyndolin:
- This catalyst
- Darkmoon Bow
- 20000 souls
- One choice only
- Plan ahead

## Notes
- The hybrid catalyst
- Unique dual scaling
- High investment needed
- For dedicated builds only
