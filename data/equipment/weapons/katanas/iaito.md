# Iaito

Katana forged in an Eastern land. The Iaito has a classic katana blade, but its hilt is crafted for quickdraw techniques. Its strong attacks are designed to emulate the fighting style of samurai.

## Acquisition
- Found in Blighttown on the upper wooden scaffolds
- Near the Shadow Set armor location
- Requires careful platforming to reach
- Jump from the platform where you find the Shadow Set

## Characteristics
The Iaito is distinguished from the Uchigatana by its unique R2 attacks that reflect traditional iaijutsu (quickdraw) techniques.

**Moveset:**
- One-handed R1: Vertical and diagonal slashes
- One-handed R2: Upward diagonal slash
- Two-handed R1: Similar to one-handed
- Two-handed R2: Delayed horizontal draw slash

**Special Properties:**
- 300 bleed buildup (30 per hit)
- Unique R2 animations
- Slightly shorter range than Uchigatana
- Same damage and scaling as Uchigatana

## Upgrades
- **Normal +15**: S-scaling in DEX at +14/+15
- **Crystal +5**: Highest damage for DEX builds
- **Fire/Chaos +5**: Removes scaling but keeps bleed
- **Divine +10**: Maintains some DEX scaling

## Notes
- Popular for its unique moveset
- R2 attacks have different timing than Uchigatana
- Excellent weapon for DEX/bleed builds
- Lower durability requires careful management
- Can be buffed when on normal upgrade path
- Fashion souls favorite for samurai cosplay
