# Chaos Blade

A curved sword born from the soul of Quelaag, daughter of the Witch of Izalith. This blade inherits only the chaotic nature of Quelaag and inflicts damage upon its wielder.

## Acquisition
- Created by Giant Blacksmith in Anor Londo
- Requires Soul of Quelaag + any katana +10
- Costs 5,000 souls to create
- Most players use Uchigatana +10 as base

## Characteristics
The Chaos Blade has the highest base damage of any katana but damages the wielder with each successful hit. This unique drawback requires careful HP management.

**Moveset:**
- Standard katana moveset
- One-handed R1: Quick slashes
- One-handed R2: Forward thrust
- Two-handed R1: Powerful slashes
- Two-handed R2: Jumping slash

**Special Properties:**
- Damages user 20 HP per successful hit
- Does not damage on missed swings
- 360 bleed buildup (36 per hit, higher than other katanas)
- Cannot be buffed

## Upgrades

- Chaos Blade → +1 (1 Demon Titanite)
- +1 → +2 (1 Demon Titanite)
- +2 → +3 (2 Demon Titanite)
- +3 → +4 (2 Demon Titanite)
