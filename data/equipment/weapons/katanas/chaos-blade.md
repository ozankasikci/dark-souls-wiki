# Chaos Blade

A curved sword born from the soul of Quelaag, daughter of the Witch of Izalith. This blade inherits only the chaotic nature of Quelaag and inflicts damage upon its wielder.

## Acquisition
- Created by Giant Blacksmith in Anor Londo
- Requires Soul of Quelaag + any katana +10
- Costs 5,000 souls to create
- Most players use Uchigatana +10 as base

## Characteristics
The Chaos Blade has the highest base damage of any katana but damages the wielder with each successful hit. This unique drawback requires careful HP management.

- One-handed R1: Quick slashes
- One-handed R2: Forward thrust
- Two-handed R1: Powerful slashes
- Two-handed R2: Jumping slash

**Special Properties:**
