# Uchigatana

The Uchigatana is a versatile katana that combines respectable damage with innate bleed buildup. Its quick moveset and excellent DEX scaling make it a favorite among dexterity builds.

## Acquisition

**Option 1 - Kill the Undead Merchant** (Undead Burg):
- Located near the first bonfire in Undead Burg
- Go down the stairs hidden behind breakable boxes
- Killing him drops the Uchigatana, a Key, Humanity, and Orange Guidance Soapstone
- **Warning**: He is the only merchant who sells Lloyd's Talismans (useful for PvP)

**Option 2 - Purchase from Shiva of the East** (Blighttown):
- Join the Forest Hunter Covenant first (talk to Alvina in Darkroot Garden)
- Shiva appears in Blighttown near the water wheel
- Costs 5,000 souls
- Does not require killing anyone

## Stats

| Stat | Value |
|------|-------|
| Physical Damage | 90 (base) |
| Weight | 5.0 |
| Durability | 80 |
| Bleed | 300 (33 per hit, procs for 30% HP) |
| Strength Scaling | E |
| Dexterity Scaling | B (A at +15) |

## Requirements

| Stat | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| Strength | 14 |
| Dexterity | 14 |

## Weapon Characteristics

The Uchigatana excels due to:
- **Quick attacks** - Fast slashes ideal for aggressive play
- **Bleed buildup** - 33 per hit, triggers 30% HP damage
- **Excellent DEX scaling** - A rank at +15
- **Low weight** - Only 5.0 units
- **Versatile moveset** - 1H and 2H attacks differ significantly

## Moveset

### One-Handed
- **R1**: Quick horizontal slashes
- **R2**: Forward thrust with good range
- **Running R1**: Stabbing thrust

### Two-Handed
- **R1**: Vertical slashes
- **R2**: Powerful overhead strike
- **Running R1**: Similar thrust

## Build Recommendations

### Pure Dexterity Build (40+ DEX)
At +15 with 40 DEX, the Uchigatana deals approximately 420 damage. Push to 45 DEX for optimal returns.

### Elemental Paths
- **Lightning +5**: Good for low-stat builds (removes scaling)
- **Fire +10**: Another scaleless option
- **Chaos +5**: Scales with humanity
- **Enchanted +5**: For INT builds

### Buffing
The Uchigatana can be buffed with:
- Resins (Gold Pine, Charcoal Pine, etc.)
- Magic Weapon / Great Magic Weapon / Crystal Magic Weapon
- Sunlight Blade / Darkmoon Blade

## Upgrades

Standard upgrade path using Titanite (Andre of Astora):
- +0 to +5: Titanite Shards
- +6 to +10: Large Titanite Shards (requires Large Ember)
- +11 to +14: Titanite Chunks
- +15: Titanite Slab

At +15: ~200 base damage with A DEX scaling

## Comparison with Other Katanas

| Katana | Reach | Bleed | Special Features |
|--------|-------|-------|------------------|
| Uchigatana | Good | 300 | Early availability, buffable |
| Iaito | Good | 300 | Different R2 (horizontal slash) |
| Washing Pole | Exceptional | 300 | Much longer, higher requirements |
| Chaos Blade | Good | 360 | Self-damage, highest damage |

## Tips

1. **Low durability** (80) means frequent repairs - carry Repair Powder or visit blacksmiths
2. **Bleed is percentage-based** - excellent against high-HP enemies and bosses
3. **R2 thrust** is excellent for spacing in both PvE and PvP
4. **Consider keeping the Undead Merchant alive** if you want Lloyd's Talismans

## Notes

- Available very early in the game (requires killing merchant or joining covenant)
- One of the most popular dexterity weapons
- Lightweight allows flexible armor choices
- Low durability is the main drawback
- The 1H R2 thrust is one of its best attacks
