# Spear

A standard spear. Longer reach than most weapons, and can be used with a shield up. However, it is difficult to hit enemies at one's feet.

## Acquisition
- Sold by Undead Male Merchant for 600 souls
- Starting equipment for Hunter class
- Found on corpses throughout Lordran
- Dropped by Undead Soldiers (spear variant)

## Characteristics
The basic spear exemplifies the weapon class's strengths: excellent reach, ability to attack while blocking, and reliable thrust damage. Perfect for cautious players.

**Moveset:**
- One-handed R1: Quick pokes
- One-handed R2: Charge thrust
- Two-handed R1: Stronger thrusts
- Two-handed R2: Sweeping attack

**Special Properties:**
- Can attack while shield is raised
- Thrust damage (Leo Ring compatible)
- Good for narrow corridors
- Low stamina consumption

## Upgrades
- **Normal +15**: Decent DEX scaling
- **Lightning +5**: Popular elemental choice
- **Fire/Chaos +5**: Good for low stats
- **Divine +10**: For Catacombs

## Notes
- Excellent beginner weapon
- "Turtle poke" strategy very safe
- Pairs well with high stability shields
- Leo Ring boosts counter damage
- Weak against groups
- Can hit through some walls
