# Notched Whip

## Overview
The Notched Whip takes the unique properties of whips and adds a vicious bleed effect, making it a specialized tool for applying pressure without the risk of being parried. Its thorny design trades slight damage for significant bleed buildup.

## Characteristics

### Advantages
- **High Bleed**: 300 buildup per hit
- **Cannot Be Parried**: Immune to parries
- **Good Range**: Whip reach advantage
- **DEX Scaling**: B becomes A at +15
- **Dual Threat**: Damage plus bleed

### Disadvantages
- **No Critical Attacks**: 0 critical modifier
- **Lower Base Damage**: 76 vs 80
- **Cannot Backstab/Riposte**: No criticals
- **Slightly Heavier**: 2.0 vs 1.5
- **Cannot Block**: No defense

## Location
Found in **Blighttown**:
- In a chest on wooden platforms
- Near the parasitic wall hugger
- Upper Blighttown area
- Dangerous to retrieve
- Watch for toxic dart snipers

## Best Practices

### Builds
The Notched Whip excels in:
- **Bleed Builds**: 300 buildup significant
- **DEX/Bleed Hybrids**: A-scaling potential
- **Anti-Parry PvP**: Safe pressure
- **Status Effect Builds**: Bleed specialist

### Upgrade Paths
- **Standard +15**: Keeps bleed, A-scaling
- **Crystal +5**: Max damage, keeps bleed
- **Lightning/Fire**: Removes bleed effect
- **Never Elemental**: Ruins the bleed

### Combat Tips
1. Focus on bleed buildup
2. Cannot be parry punished
3. Range harassment safe
4. Mix with other bleed weapons
5. Pressure without critical risk

## Bleed Mechanics
300 buildup means:
- 2-4 hits to bleed most enemies
- 30-50% max HP damage
- Psychological pressure in PvP
- Forces healing/moss
- Stacks with other sources

## PvP Applications
Double threat:
- Cannot be parried
- Bleed pressure
- Forces different strategy
- Safe chip damage
- Mental pressure

## Comparison to Regular Whip
- **vs Whip**: Lower damage, has bleed
- **Trade-off**: 4 damage for 300 bleed
- **Same Properties**: No parry/critical
- **Different Roles**: Bleed vs pure damage

## Synergies
Works well with:
- Bloodbite Ring (defense)
- Other bleed weapons
- Poison throwing knives
- Pressure tactics
- Hit-and-run style

## Limitations
Same as regular whip:
- No backstabs ever
- No ripostes possible
- Pure attrition combat
- Requires patience
- Not for critical fishers

## Fashion Souls
Perfect for:
- Torture builds
- Blighttown native
- Bleed specialist
- Darkwraith themes

## Blighttown Retrieval
Getting it safely:
1. Spider shield for toxic
2. Clear dart snipers first
3. Kill wall hugger
4. Open chest carefully
5. Escape route planned

## Advanced Tactics
- Bleed timer pressure
- Swap with regular whip
- Force moss usage
- Combine with throwing knives
- Psychological warfare

## Notes
- Popular in bleed-focused builds
- The thorns are visible on model
- Requires different combat approach
- Embodies Blighttown's cruelty
