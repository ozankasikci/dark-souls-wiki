# Whip

## Overview
The Whip is Dark Souls' most unconventional weapon, offering unique properties that defy traditional combat mechanics. While it cannot perform critical attacks, its inability to be parried makes it a specialist tool for specific situations.

## Characteristics

### Advantages
- **Cannot Be Parried**: Completely safe from parries
- **Good DEX Scaling**: B-rank becomes A
- **Excellent Range**: Surprising reach
- **Very Light**: Only 1.5 weight
- **Unique Properties**: Goes through shields partially

### Disadvantages
- **No Critical Attacks**: 0 critical modifier
- **Cannot Backstab**: Major damage loss
- **Cannot Riposte**: No parry follow-up
- **Low Base Damage**: Only 80
- **Cannot Block**: 0% damage reduction

## Location
Dropped by **Xanthous King Jeremiah**:
- Invades in Painted World of Ariamis
- Near Priscilla's boss area
- Must be human to be invaded

## Best Practices

### Builds
The Whip excels in:
- **Anti-Parry Builds**: PvP specialist
- **DEX Builds**: A-scaling at +15
- **Range Harassment**: Keep distance
- **Unique Playstyles**: Non-traditional combat

### Upgrade Paths
- **Standard +15**: Maximizes DEX scaling (A-rank)
- **Crystal +5**: Maximum damage, no repair
- **Lightning/Fire**: Removes scaling for consistent damage

### Combat Tips
1. Abuse the parry immunity
2. Use range to stay safe

4. Cannot be punished by parries
5. Chip damage through shields
