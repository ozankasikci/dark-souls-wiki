# Avelyn

## Overview
The Avelyn is Dark Souls' only repeating crossbow, firing three bolts in rapid succession. This unique mechanism offers burst damage potential at the cost of shield-firing capability and ammo efficiency.

## Characteristics

### Advantages
- **Triple Shot**: 3 bolts per trigger
- **Burst Damage**: 111 total base
- **Unique Weapon**: Only repeater
- **Surprise Factor**: Unexpected burst
- **Style Points**: Mechanical marvel

### Disadvantages
- **Cannot Shield-Fire**: Two-hand only
- **Low Per-Bolt Damage**: 37 each
- **Heavy Weight**: 6.0 units
- **Triple Ammo Cost**: Burns bolts
- **Spread Pattern**: Not all hit

## Location
Duke's Archives:
- **On Bookshelf**: Upper level
- **Moving Stairs Area**: Careful positioning
- **One Per Playthrough**: Unique find
- **Late Game**: Archives access needed

## Best Practices

### Builds
Avelyn suits:
- **Quality Builds**: 16/14 requirements
- **Burst Damage Focus**: Alpha strike
- **PvP Surprise**: Catching opponents
- **Fun Builds**: Style priority

### Triple Shot Mechanics
How it works:
- First bolt accurate
- Second slightly spreads
- Third spreads more
- Close range all hit
- Distance reduces accuracy

### Combat Tips
1. Close range for all hits
2. Aim center mass
3. Burst surprise value
4. Ammo management crucial
5. Two-hand required

## Damage Calculation
Real damage:
- 37 x 3 = 111 if all hit
- 92 x 3 = 276 at +15
- Distance affects total
- Not all bolts guaranteed
- Burst potential high

## Comparison
- **vs Heavy Crossbow**: Burst vs single
- **vs Light Crossbow**: No shield option
- **vs Sniper**: Close range focus
- **Role**: Burst damage dealer

## Ammo Economy
Triple consumption:
- 3 bolts per shot
- 99 = 33 shots only
- Expensive to use
- Plan accordingly
- Not for general use

## PvP Applications
Surprise weapon:
- Unexpected burst
- Roll catch potential
- Punish mistakes
- One-shot capability
- Mental impact

## The Spread Problem
At distance:
- Not all bolts hit
- Damage unreliable
- Close range optimal
- Medium range okay
- Long range wasteful

## Duke's Archives Location
Getting Avelyn:
1. Reach upper library
2. Use moving stairs
3. Position correctly
4. Jump to bookshelf
5. Careful not to fall

## Weight Consideration
6.0 weight for:
- Unique mechanism
- Burst potential
- Style factor
- Niche use
- Fashion statement

## Upgrade Priority
Worth it if:
- Main crossbow user
- PvP focused
- Like the style
- Ammo not issue
- Committed to burst

## Fashion and Style
Mechanical marvel:
- Visible mechanism
- Steampunk aesthetic
- Eccentric design
- Conversation piece
- Unique appearance

## Elemental Paths
Consider:
- Lightning +5: Fixed burst
- Standard +15: Maximum damage
- No scaling anyway
- Burst multiplied
- Big numbers possible

## Practical Reality
Truth about Avelyn:
- Cool but impractical
- Ammo hungry
- Situational weapon
- Fun factor high
- Not optimal choice

## Notes
- The burst crossbow
- Style over substance
- Unique firing mechanism
- Fun but flawed weapon
