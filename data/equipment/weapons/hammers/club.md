# Club

## Overview
The Club is one of the simplest weapons in Dark Souls, but don't let its crude appearance fool you. With exceptional strength scaling and low requirements, it's a surprisingly effective weapon for strength-focused builds.

## Characteristics

### Advantages
- **A-rank Strength Scaling**: Among the best strength scaling in the game
- **Low Requirements**: Only needs 10 Strength to wield
- **High Durability**: 250 durability means it rarely needs repair
- **Lightweight**: At 3.0 units, it's easy to fit into any build
- **Early Availability**: Starting equipment or cheap to purchase

### Disadvantages
- **Short Range**: Limited reach compared to other weapons
- **No Dexterity Scaling**: Pure strength weapon only
- **Basic Moveset**: Simple attacks without much variety
- **Low Critical Modifier**: Only 100 critical damage

## Location
- Starting equipment for the **Deprived** class
- Can be purchased from the **Undead Male Merchant** in Undead Burg for 150 souls
- Sometimes dropped by Hollow enemies wielding clubs

## Best Practices

### Builds
The Club excels in pure strength builds due to its A-rank scaling. It's particularly effective when:
- Two-handed for maximum damage output
- Buffed with resins or spells
- Used as a backup weapon for its low weight

### Upgrade Paths
- **Standard +15**: Maximizes the A-rank strength scaling
- **Crystal**: For maximum damage at the cost of durability
- **Lightning/Fire**: Removes scaling but adds elemental damage
- **Chaos**: Scales with humanity for elemental builds

### Combat Tips
1. The overhead smash has deceptive range
2. Two-handed strong attacks can break guards
3. Jumping attacks are excellent for closing distance
4. Works well with the Leo Ring for counter damage

## Comparison to Other Hammers
While the Mace offers better base damage and the Reinforced Club has bleed, the Club's superior scaling makes it the strongest hammer at high strength levels. Its simplicity is its strength.

## Notes
- Often underestimated in PvP due to its appearance
- The strong attack can hit enemies behind you
- Excellent for strength-based challenge runs
- Can stunlock lighter enemies effectively
