# Mace

## Overview
The Mace is a reliable hammer weapon that serves as the middle ground between the Club and more specialized hammers. As the starting weapon for Clerics, it's designed to crush both bones and armor with equal efficiency.

## Characteristics

### Advantages
- **Higher Base Damage**: Slightly stronger than the Club initially
- **Good Scaling Progression**: B-rank that becomes A at +15
- **Strike Damage**: Particularly effective against heavily armored foes
- **Reliable Moveset**: Straightforward attacks that are easy to use
- **Decent Durability**: 250 points ensures longevity

### Disadvantages
- **Heavier than Club**: 4.0 weight vs 3.0
- **Higher Requirements**: Needs 12 Strength instead of 10
- **Short Range**: Limited reach like all hammers
- **No Special Properties**: Lacks bleed or other effects

## Location
- Found in a chest on the upper level near **Blacksmith Andre** in Undead Parish
- Starting equipment for the **Cleric** class
- Sold by **Patches the Hyena** for 1,000 souls after he becomes a merchant
- Rarely dropped by Undead Soldiers (hammer variant)

## Best Practices

### Builds
The Mace works well in:
- Faith/Strength hybrid builds (Cleric starting weapon)
- Pure strength builds as a reliable backup
- Early game builds before acquiring specialized weapons

### Upgrade Paths
- **Standard +15**: Best for strength builds to achieve A-scaling
- **Divine**: Perfect for faith builds, maintains the Cleric theme
- **Occult**: Alternative faith scaling with different damage properties
- **Raw**: For low-level builds that don't invest in strength

### Combat Tips
1. The overhead strong attack has surprising forward momentum
2. Running attacks are excellent for chasing
3. Works well with poise to trade hits
4. The regular R1 combo is faster than it appears

## Comparison to Other Hammers
- **vs Club**: Higher base damage but worse initial scaling
- **vs Morning Star**: No bleed but more consistent damage
- **vs Reinforced Club**: No bleed but better scaling potential
- **vs Warpick**: Better for pure physical builds

## Synergies
- **Miracles**: Natural pairing for Cleric builds
- **Great Magic Barrier**: Tank through magic while crushing casters
- **Force**: Push enemies away to reset spacing
- **Ring of the Sun's Firstborn**: For divine upgrade paths

## Notes
- The improved scaling at +15 makes late-game investment worthwhile
- Effective in the Catacombs when made Divine
- The strong attack can hit enemies slightly behind you
- Popular choice for SL1 runs when two-handed
