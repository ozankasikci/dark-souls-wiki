# Morning Star

## Overview
The Morning Star is a unique hammer that combines blunt force trauma with bleeding damage. Its spiked ball design makes it particularly cruel against flesh and blood enemies, though its lower durability requires more careful use.

## Characteristics

### Advantages
- **Bleed Effect**: 300 bleed buildup is significant
- **Low Requirements**: Only needs 11 Strength
- **Unique in Class**: Only hammer with inherent bleed
- **Free Acquisition**: Found early in Firelink Shrine
- **Versatile Damage**: Physical plus bleed pressure

### Disadvantages
- **Lower Durability**: 180 vs 250 for most hammers
- **Weaker Scaling**: C-rank strength scaling throughout
- **Lower Base Damage**: Weaker than Mace or Club
- **No Scaling Improvement**: Stays at C even at +15

## Location
Found on a corpse in **Firelink Shrine**:
- Take the elevator down to New Londo Ruins
- Look for a corpse on a ledge near the elevator shaft
- The corpse holds the Morning Star
- Can be obtained immediately upon reaching Firelink

## Best Practices

### Builds
The Morning Star excels in:
- Bleed-focused builds with Bloodbite Ring
- Low-level invasions for bleed pressure
- Backup weapon for tough enemies vulnerable to bleed
- Quality builds that can't use katanas effectively

### Upgrade Paths
- **Standard +15**: Maintains bleed while maximizing damage
- **Crystal**: Maximum damage but loses repair ability
- **Raw**: For minimum stat investment builds
- **Magic/Enchanted**: Adds INT scaling but removes bleed
- **Note**: Lightning/Fire paths remove bleed effect

### Combat Tips
1. Focus on consistent hits to build bleed
2. Two-handed attacks build bleed faster
3. Combine with Bloodbite Ring against bleed enemies
4. The wide strong attack can catch rolls

## Bleed Mechanics
- 300 bleed buildup is applied per hit
- Most enemies have 200-300 bleed resistance
- Bleed deals 30-50% of enemy's max HP
- Works on most organic enemies, not on skeletons or ghosts

## Comparison to Other Weapons
- **vs Other Hammers**: Only hammer with bleed
- **vs Reinforced Club**: Similar concept but different execution
- **vs Katanas**: Less bleed but better poise damage
- **vs Priscilla's Dagger**: More practical for strength builds

## Notable Uses
- Effective against: Demon Firesage, Stray Demon, most NPCs
- Less effective against: Skeletons, Ghosts, most bosses
- PvP: Psychological pressure from bleed meter
- Speedruns: Quick Firelink pickup for early bleed

## Notes
- The flail head has slightly different hitboxes than other hammers
- Can hit around shields more easily due to flail physics
- Popular choice for "bleed everything" challenge runs
- The lower durability becomes noticeable in longer areas
