# Warpick

## Overview
The Warpick is a unique hammer that defies classification by dealing thrust damage instead of strike damage. This peculiar weapon combines the weight class of hammers with the damage type of spears, creating interesting tactical opportunities.

## Characteristics

### Advantages
- **Thrust Damage**: Unique among hammers
- **Leo Ring Compatible**: Benefits from counter damage
- **Dual Scaling**: Both STR and DEX scaling
- **Good Base Damage**: Equal to the Mace
- **Lower Weight**: 3.5 units vs 4.0 for Mace

### Disadvantages
- **Split Scaling**: Neither scaling is exceptional
- **Requires DEX**: Unusual for a hammer
- **Lower Durability**: 220 vs 250 for most hammers
- **Narrow Hitbox**: Thrust attacks can miss more easily

## Location
Dropped by **Pickaxe-wielding Undead** in the Catacombs:
- Found throughout the Catacombs
- Higher drop rate from the ones near Vamos
- Can be farmed with item discovery gear
- Not guaranteed drop, requires patience

## Best Practices

### Builds
The Warpick works well in:
- Quality builds that level both STR and DEX
- Leo Ring counter-damage builds
- Hybrid builds that want hammer poise damage
- Unconventional PvP builds for surprise factor

### Upgrade Paths
- **Standard +15**: Best for quality builds
- **Crystal**: Maximum damage for dedicated builds
- **Lightning/Fire**: Removes scaling but consistent damage
- **Raw**: For minimum stat builds

### Combat Tips
1. Thrust attacks can hit between shield gaps
2. Leo Ring significantly boosts counter damage
3. Running attacks have excellent reach
4. Can hit enemies other hammers might miss

## Damage Type Advantages
- **vs Heavy Armor**: Thrust often has better modifiers
- **vs Shields**: Can partially pierce some shields
- **Narrow Spaces**: Thrust attacks work in corridors
- **Counter Hits**: 40% bonus damage with Leo Ring

## Comparison to Other Weapons
- **vs Other Hammers**: Only thrust-damage hammer
- **vs Spears**: Better poise damage, worse reach
- **vs Estoc**: Similar concept, different weight class
- **vs Pickaxe**: More refined version of the same idea

## PvP Applications
- Unexpected damage type catches opponents off-guard
- Leo Ring counters can be devastating
- Hammer poise damage with spear properties
- Mix-ups between this and traditional hammers

## Notes
- The thrust damage type is calculated differently against armor
- Can backstab and riposte like other hammers
- The unique moveset takes time to master
- Often overlooked due to farming requirements
