# Hammer of Vamos

## Overview
The Hammer of Vamos is a unique weapon that embodies the Royal Blacksmith's connection to the flame. This cursed tool carries both the weight of its master's craft and the fires of the Catacombs, making it a peculiar trophy weapon.

## Characteristics

### Advantages
- **Split Damage**: 115 physical + 64 fire
- **No Stat Requirements**: Beyond base 14 STR
- **Fire Damage**: Effective against certain enemies
- **Unique Weapon**: One-of-a-kind hammer
- **High Total AR**: 179 combined damage

### Disadvantages
- **Cannot Be Upgraded**: Stuck at base stats
- **No Scaling**: Damage never improves
- **Requires Killing Vamos**: Loses Fire/Chaos upgrades
- **Split Damage**: Reduced by two defense types
- **Heavy**: 5.0 weight units

## Location
Obtained by killing **Blacksmith Vamos** in the Catacombs:
- Found at the bottom of the Catacombs
- Near the entrance to Tomb of the Giants
- **WARNING**: Killing Vamos permanently locks you out of Fire and Chaos weapon upgrades
- Consider carefully before obtaining

## Critical Decision
Killing Vamos means:
- No Fire weapon upgrades
- No Chaos weapon upgrades
- Loss of a merchant
- Permanent decision per playthrough
- Generally not worth it for the hammer

## Best Practices

### When to Consider
- End of playthrough collection
- NG+ when upgrades aren't needed
- Specific challenge runs
- Complete weapon collection goals

### Combat Application
- Early Catacombs before placing Lordvessel
- Against enemies weak to fire
- Low-level runs where scaling doesn't matter
- PvP surprise factor

### Build Considerations
Since it has no scaling:
- Minimum 14 STR to wield
- Any build can use it equally
- Best for low-level characters
- Pairs with fire-resistant armor

## Damage Calculation
- 115 physical damage vs physical defense
- 64 fire damage vs fire defense
- Both must overcome separate defenses
- Often deals less than the 179 AR suggests
- Effective against low-defense enemies

## Lore Implications
- Vamos was the Royal Blacksmith
- The hammer contains Catacomb's curse
- Fire damage reflects his craft specialty
- Represents lost smithing traditions

## Comparison to Other Hammers
- **vs Blacksmith's Hammer**: Has fire damage
- **vs Fire Mace +10**: Cannot be upgraded
- **vs Regular Hammers**: No scaling hurts long-term
- **Unique Properties**: Only fire-damage hammer

## Trophy Weapon Status
Like many NPC weapons:
- More valuable as collection piece
- Sacrifice gameplay options to obtain
- Represents completed NPC questline
- Not optimal for regular use

## Notes
- The fire visual effects are unique
- Cannot be buffed with resins
- Popular for "kill all NPCs" runs
- Often obtained just before NG+
