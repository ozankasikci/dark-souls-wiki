# Reinforced Club

## Overview
The Reinforced Club is the bruiser of the basic hammers, combining the highest base damage with a bleed effect. Its metal spikes turn a simple wooden club into a fearsome weapon capable of crushing armor and drawing blood.

## Characteristics

### Advantages
- **Highest Base Damage**: 97 damage beats all basic hammers
- **Bleed Effect**: 180 bleed buildup per hit
- **Exceptional Jump Attack**: Unique leaping R2
- **High Durability**: 250 ensures reliability
- **Early Availability**: Purchasable from the start

### Disadvantages
- **C-Rank Scaling Only**: Never improves beyond C
- **Lower Bleed than Morning Star**: 180 vs 300
- **Heavier Weight**: 4.0 units
- **Higher Requirements**: Needs 12 STR

## Location
- Sold by **Undead Male Merchant** in Undead Burg for 350 souls
- Located near the first Undead Burg bonfire
- Can be purchased immediately with starting souls
- Unlimited stock

## Best Practices

### Builds
The Reinforced Club is famous for:
- **SL1 Runs**: The go-to weapon for Pyromancer challenges
- **Low-Level Invasions**: High damage with bleed pressure
- **Strength Builds**: Excellent early-game option
- **Jump Attack Builds**: Unique leaping R2

### Upgrade Paths
- **Standard +15**: Maximizes both damage and bleed
- **Lightning/Fire +5**: Removes bleed but adds element
- **Crystal +5**: Maximum damage, no repair
- **Raw +5**: For base stat builds

### Combat Tips
1. The jump attack (forward + R2) has unique properties
2. Can combo R1 into jump attack
3. Bleed pressure forces aggressive play
4. Two-handed for poise breaking

## The Famous Jump Attack
The Reinforced Club's strong attack is unique:
- Performs a leaping overhead slam
- Covers significant distance
- Has different timing than other weapons
- Can dodge some attacks while attacking
- Devastating against large enemies

## SL1 Weapon of Choice
Why it dominates Level 1 runs:
- Two-handed requirement only needs 8 STR
- High base damage compensates for low stats
- Bleed provides percentage-based damage
- Available immediately
- Upgrade materials are accessible

## Comparison to Other Hammers
- **vs Club**: Higher damage, has bleed, worse scaling
- **vs Morning Star**: More damage, less bleed
- **vs Mace**: More damage, has bleed, worse scaling
- **Best of Both**: Combines Club damage with bleed

## PvP Applications
- Jump attack catches rolls and wakeups
- Bleed pressure in invasions
- Unexpected range on leap attack
- Strong poise damage for trades

## Notes
- The jump attack can leap over some low attacks
- Bleed works on most bosses except Quelaag, Seath
- The weapon's appearance intimidates in PvP
- Speedrunners often grab this immediately
