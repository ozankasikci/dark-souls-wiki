# Blacksmith's Hammer

## Overview
The Blacksmith's Hammer represents the tools of the trade, serving double duty as both a smithing implement and a weapon of war. While not the strongest hammer, it carries the weight of tradition and craftsmanship.

## Characteristics

### Advantages
- **Unique Strong Attack**: Different R2 animation
- **Solid Durability**: 250 points of reliability
- **Thematic Weapon**: Perfect for blacksmith cosplay
- **Available from NPCs**: Multiple acquisition methods

### Disadvantages
- **Heaviest Basic Hammer**: 5.0 weight units
- **Cannot Be Buffed**: No resins or weapon spells
- **Higher Requirements**: 14 STR needed
- **Average Performance**: No standout features

## Location
Can be obtained through various means:
- Dropped by **Andre of Astora** if killed (not recommended)
- Dropped by **Blacksmith Vamos** if killed
- Purchased from **Giant Blacksmith** for 800 souls
- Purchased from **Blacksmith Vamos** for 800 souls

## Best Practices

### Builds
The Blacksmith's Hammer suits:
- Cosplay/roleplay builds
- Mid-game strength builds
- Collection completionists
- Backup weapon for specific situations

### Upgrade Paths
- **Standard +15**: Only viable path due to buff restrictions
- **Cannot be infused**: Maintains pure physical damage
- **Crystal**: Technically possible but thematically wrong

### Combat Tips
1. The unique R2 has different timing
2. Heavier weight affects stamina management
3. Plan around inability to buff
4. Strong attack can catch off-guard opponents

## Lore Significance
- Represents the backbone of Lordran's economy
- Each blacksmith's hammer tells their story
- Symbol of creation amid destruction
- The tool that maintains the Chosen Undead's arsenal

## Comparison to Other Hammers
- **vs Mace**: Heavier, cannot be buffed
- **vs Club**: Much heavier, no scaling advantage
- **vs Reinforced Club**: Less damage, no bleed
- **Worst stat efficiency**: Among basic hammers

## Special Properties
The inability to buff suggests:
- Already perfectly balanced by master smiths
- The metal resists magical enhancement
- Represents pure physical craftsmanship
- Game balance to prevent Andre farming

## Role-Playing Applications
- Complete blacksmith cosplay builds
- Pacifist runs (using only tools)
- Tribute builds to fallen NPCs
- "Working class hero" themed characters

## Notes
- Killing Andre locks you out of many upgrades
- The unique R2 animation shows smithing motions
- One of the few weapons that cannot be buffed
- Often kept as a trophy rather than used
