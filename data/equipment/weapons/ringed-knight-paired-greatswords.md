# Ringed Knight Paired Greatswords

The Ringed Knight Paired Greatswords (RKPGS) are arguably the most spectacular weapon in Dark Souls III. These massive paired ultra greatswords combine devastating damage with an incredible moveset featuring aerial combos.

## The L1 Combo

The defining feature of RKPGS:
1. **L1**: Wide horizontal sweep
2. **L1**: Follow-up sweep
3. **L1**: Launch into aerial spin
4. **L1**: Slam down with fire explosion

Total combo damage: ~1200-1500

## Build Optimization

### Quality Build (SL 120)
- **VIG**: 40
- **END**: 40 (combo requires stamina)
- **STR**: 40
- **DEX**: 40
- **VIT**: 26+ (very heavy weapon)

### Strength Focus (SL 120)
- **VIG**: 40
- **END**: 40
- **STR**: 66
- **DEX**: 15 (minimum)
- **VIT**: 30+

## Combat Mechanics

### Combo Properties
- **Hyper Armor**: Active throughout L1 chain
- **Tracking**: Excellent on first 3 hits
- **AOE**: Final slam has wide fire blast
- **Stamina**: Full combo costs ~160 stamina

### Mix-up Options
- L1 → L1 → R1 (instead of full combo)
- Single L1 → wait → L1 (reset)
- R1 → L1 (standard into paired)
- Running L1 (gap closer)

## PvP Dominance

### Why They're Feared
1. **Phantom Range**: Deceptively long reach
2. **Roll Catching**: L1 tracks dodge attempts
3. **Trade Potential**: Hyper armor wins exchanges
4. **Intimidation**: Psychological pressure

### Counters
- Backstab fishing (long animations)
- Crossbow interrupts
- Spacing and patience
- Parrying (R1 attacks only)

## Damage Calculations

| Attack | Physical | Fire | Total |
|--------|----------|------|--------|
| L1 (first) | 370 | 170 | 540 |
| L1 (second) | 296 | 136 | 432 |
| L1 (spin) | 444 | 204 | 648 |
| L1 (slam) | 518 | 238 | 756 |

## Equipment Synergy

### Rings
1. **Havel's Ring +3**: Essential for weight
2. **Ring of Favor +3**: HP/Stamina/Equip Load
3. **Life Ring +3**: Survive trades
4. **Prisoner's Chain**: 15 free levels

### Armor
- **Havel's Set**: Maximum poise
- **Lapp's Set**: Good poise/weight ratio
- **Mixed Sets**: Optimize poise breakpoints

## Advanced Techniques

### Wake-up Pressure
- Time L1 as opponent rises
- Forces roll or block
- Follow their escape option

### Ledge Game
- L1 combo near edges
- Final slam can knock off
- Aerial portion catches jumps

### Stamina Management
- Never full combo without 160+ stamina
- Green Blossoms recommended
- Chloranthy Ring +3 helps recovery

## Historical Lore

The Ringed Knights' burden:
- Gifted by Gwyn to Pygmy Lords
- Rings of fire = symbols of slavery
- Knights guard the dark soul
- Weapons burn with abyssal fire
