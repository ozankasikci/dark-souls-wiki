# Canvas Talisman

## Overview
The Canvas Talisman represents the standard for dedicated faith builds, offering A-rank scaling and optimal performance for mid-range Faith investment (27-39). Patches' exclusive merchandise for the faithful.

## Characteristics

### Advantages

- **Good Magic Adjust**: 220 at +15
- **Patches Exclusive**: Unique source

### Disadvantages
- **14 FAI Required**: Higher barrier
- **Patches Dependent**: Questline needed
- **Outclassed at 40+**: Better options
- **Standard Talisman**: No special effects
- **Mid-Range Only**: Specific niche

## Location
From Patches:
- **Tomb of Giants**: Find him
- **Don't kill Nito**: First
- **Complete his trap**: Forgive
- **Returns to Firelink**: Merchant
- **1000 souls**: Purchase

## Best Practices

- Before Darkmoon dominates
- Common FAI range
- First playthrough perfect
- Natural progression

- 30 FAI builds

2. Upgrade priority high
3. Standard miracles
4. R2/L2 casting
5. Light weight bonus

## The Patches Problem
