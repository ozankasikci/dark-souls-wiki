# Talisman

## Overview
The basic Talisman serves as the entry-level miracle catalyst, offering consistent C-rank Faith scaling. It's optimal for low Faith builds (10-26) and serves as many players' first miracle-casting tool.

## Characteristics

### Advantages
- **Low Requirements**: 10 FAI only
- **Lightweight**: 0.3 weight
- **Best for 10-26 FAI**: Early game king
- **Always Available**: Multiple sources
- **Cheap**: 1000 souls

### Disadvantages
- **Fixed C-Scaling**: Never improves
- **Low Magic Adjust**: Caps at 172
- **Outclassed Later**: By other talismans
- **Basic Tool**: No special properties
- **Limited Growth**: Low ceiling

## Location
Easy acquisition:
- **Cleric Starting Gear**: Free
- **Petrus of Thorolund**: 1000 souls
- **Firelink Shrine**: Early access
- **Always Available**: Reliable

## Best Practices

### Low Faith Focus
10-26 FAI because:
- Best in this range
- Before Canvas shines
- Minimal investment
- Utility miracles viable
- Early game perfect

### Miracle Selection
Good for:
- Heal
- Force
- Homeward
- Magic Barrier
- Utility focus

### Combat Tips
1. R2/L2 for miracles
2. Light weight advantage
3. Know FAI breakpoints
4. Upgrade helps slightly
5. Transition later

## FAI Breakpoints
Talisman optimization:
- 10-26 FAI: Use this
- 27-39 FAI: Canvas
- 40-49 FAI: Darkmoon
- 50 FAI: Darkmoon/Sunlight

## Comparison
- **vs Canvas**: Better under 27 FAI
- **vs Darkmoon**: Much weaker
- **vs Sunlight**: Different league
- **Role**: Starter catalyst

## Upgrade Value
Worth upgrading?
- Small gains (100â†’172)
- Cheap materials
- If main talisman
- Early game yes
- Late game skip

## Weight Excellence
0.3 weight means:
- Negligible burden
- Any build works
- No sacrifices
- Perfect backup
- Always carryable

## Petrus Connection
From Thorolund:
- Way of White member
- Early NPC
- Questline involved
- Betrayer later
- Lore significance

## Utility Build Synergy
Perfect for:
- Non-FAI builds
- Minimal investment
- Heal access
- Homeward bones save
- Quality of life

## Fashion Simplicity
Basic design:
- Standard talisman
- White cloth
- Cleric aesthetic
- No frills
- Functional look

## C-Scaling Reality
What this means:
- Never gets better
- Consistent but limited
- Predictable output
- No surprises
- Know the ceiling

## Early Game Value
Starting with this:
- Immediate miracles
- Heal from start
- Force utility
- Game easier
- Natural progression

## When to Replace
Move on when:
- 27+ FAI reached
- Canvas available
- Better options found
- Build evolves
- Power needed

## PvP Limitations
For PvP:
- Utility only
- No damage miracles
- Support role
- Not competitive
- PvE focused

## Notes
- The starter talisman
- Best for low Faith
- Transition to better later
- Reliable early game tool
