# Flamberge

A greatsword with an undulating blade. The blade is sharp and thin, but designed to be wielded with agility rather than strength. Its bleeding effect is enhanced by its rippled blade.

## Acquisition
- Rare drop from Serpent Mages in Sen's Fortress (0.5% drop rate)
- Only dropped by the mages, not the regular serpent soldiers
- Use Gold Serpent Ring and humanity to improve drop rate

## Characteristics
The Flamberge is unique among greatswords for causing bleed buildup. Its wavy blade design isn't just cosmetic - it inflicts bleeding damage on enemies.

**Moveset:**
- Similar to other greatswords
- One-handed R1: Horizontal slashes
- One-handed R2: Thrust
- Two-handed R1: Overhead slams
- Two-handed R2: Wide sweep

**Special Properties:**
- 300 bleed buildup (36 bleed per hit)
- Lower base damage compensated by bleed
- Slightly better DEX scaling than most greatswords

## Upgrades
- **Normal +15**: Maintains bleed effect
- **Crystal +5**: Loses bleed but highest damage
- **Chaos/Fire +5**: Removes scaling and bleed
- **Enchanted +5**: Best for INT builds

## Notes
- Only greatsword with natural bleed
- Excellent against bleed-vulnerable enemies
- Lower durability than other greatswords
- Rare drop makes it hard to obtain
- Fashion souls favorite due to unique design
- Bleed builds pair well with Shadow Set
