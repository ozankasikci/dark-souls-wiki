# Bastard Sword

A standard greatsword. Greatswords are a high damage, long reach weapon class. They are effective against most enemies and are widely used.

## Acquisition
- Sold by Andre of Astora for 3,000 souls
- Found in a chest in the graveyard near Firelink Shrine
- Starting equipment for the Knight class in some versions

## Characteristics
The Bastard Sword is often overshadowed by the Claymore but has its own advantages: lower stat requirements and weight make it accessible earlier and easier to fit into builds.

**Moveset:**
- One-handed R1: Horizontal slashes
- One-handed R2: Thrust attack
- Two-handed R1: Vertical slams
- Two-handed R2: Wide horizontal sweep

## Upgrades
- **Normal +15**: Best for quality builds (C/C scaling)
- **Lightning +5**: Good elemental option
- **Divine +10**: For Catacombs/Nito
- **Crystal +5**: Maximum damage but breaks

Upgrade materials:
- +0 to +5: Titanite Shards
- +6 to +10: Large Titanite Shards
- +11 to +14: Titanite Chunks
- +15: Titanite Slab

## Notes
- Good starter greatsword
- Lower requirements than Claymore (16/10 vs 16/13)
- Lighter than most greatswords
- Decent quality weapon scaling
- Often replaced by Claymore due to better moveset
