## Acquisition
- Created by Giant Blacksmith using Soul of Sif
- Requires any broken straight sword or straight sword hilt at +10
- Costs 5,000 souls to create
- Note: There are two versions - this is the "true" version

## Characteristics
This legendary blade deals split physical and magic damage and has unique properties inherited from Artorias's covenant with the Abyss.
