# Great Lord Greatsword

Sword born from the soul of Gwyn, Lord of Cinder. As bearer of the ultimate soul, Gwyn wielded the bolts of the sun, but before linking the fire, divided that power amongst his children.

## Acquisition
- Created by Giant Blacksmith in Anor Londo
- Requires Soul of Gwyn + any greatsword +10
- Costs 5,000 souls to create
- Gwyn is the final boss

## Characteristics
The Great Lord Greatsword has the highest base damage of any greatsword but suffers from poor scaling.

**Moveset:**
- Standard greatsword moveset
- One-handed R1: Horizontal sweeps
- One-handed R2: Overhead slam
- Two-handed R1: Vertical cuts
- Two-handed R2: Thrust

**Special Properties:**
- Extremely high base damage (256)
- Very poor scaling (D/D)
- Cannot be buffed
- Light for its damage
- No special effects

## Upgrades
Boss weapon, upgraded with Demon Titanite:
- Base → +1 (1 Demon Titanite)
- +1 → +2 (1 Demon Titanite)
- +2 → +3 (2 Demon Titanite)
- +3 → +4 (2 Demon Titanite)
- +4 → +5 (4 Demon Titanite)

At +5: 384 physical damage

## Notes
- Disappointing for final boss weapon
- Poor scaling limits effectiveness
- High base damage helps low-stat builds
- Consider Sunlight Spear instead
- Gwyn's actual sword in lore
- Symbol of linking the fire
