The Black Knight Sword is a powerful greatsword with unique properties against demons. Once wielded by the knights who followed Gwyn to the Kiln of the First Flame, these weapons were charred black and imbued with special power.

## Special Properties

- **20% bonus damage** against all demon-type enemies
- Cannot be buffed or infused

- **One-handed R2**: Overhead slam
- **Two-handed R1**: Vertical slashes with increased range
- **Two-handed R2**: Powerful thrust with knockback
- **Weapon Art - Stomp**: Plant feet to brace for incoming attacks, follow up with launching uppercut

## Combat Strategy

### PvE
Exceptionally effective against:

### PvP
- High damage per hit rewards careful spacing
- R2 thrust catches rolls effectively
- Stomp weapon art counters aggressive players
