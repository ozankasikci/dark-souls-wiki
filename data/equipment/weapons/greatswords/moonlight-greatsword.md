# Moonlight Greatsword

A legendary sword created from the tail of Seath the Scaleless, the pale dragon who betrayed his own kind. This weapon has appeared throughout the Souls series and is the signature weapon of intelligence-based builds.

## Acquisition

**How to obtain:**
- Cut off Seath the Scaleless's tail during the boss fight
- Must hit the TIP of the middle tail (not the base)
- Requires approximately 825 damage to the tail tip
- Sword transfers directly to inventory after patch 1.05
- Can be missed if you kill Seath without cutting the tail

**Strategy tips:**
- Lure Seath close to the Primordial Crystal
- Let him destroy the crystal with his breath attack (stuns him)
- While stunned, run behind him and attack the tail tip
- Great Combustion works well (3 casts with +10 Pyromancy Flame)
- Keep equipment load under 25% for mobility
