# Moonlight Greatsword

A legendary weapon that has appeared throughout the Dark Souls series, the Moonlight Greatsword is the signature weapon of intelligence-based builds. This ethereal blade deals pure magic damage and can project waves of moonlight.

## Unique Features

- **Pure magic damage** - No physical component
- **Weapon Art - Moonlight Vortex**: Charge blade with moonlight, then release wave projectiles
- Projectiles consume durability instead of FP
- Self-buffing weapon art increases damage temporarily

## Scaling & Requirements

### Intelligence Scaling
- B scaling at +0
- A scaling at +3
- S scaling at +5 (maximum reinforcement)

### Build Requirements
- **Minimum**: 16 STR / 11 DEX / 26 INT
- **Optimal**: 16 STR / 11 DEX / 60 INT
- **PvP Meta**: 16 STR / 11 DEX / 60-80 INT

## Combat Applications

### Advantages
- Long range projectiles for zoning
- High magic damage punishes low magic defense
- Self-buff stacks with other buffs
- Excellent for INT/melee hybrid builds

### Disadvantages
- Completely countered by high magic resistance
- Cannot be buffed with resins or spells
- Heavy weight for caster builds
- Split stat requirements

## Projectile Mechanics

| Charge Level | Damage | Durability Cost | Range |
|--------------|---------|-----------------|--------|
| Uncharged R2 | 80% AR | 4 | Medium |
| Charged R2 | 100% AR | 10 | Long |
| Buffed R2 | 120% AR | 10 | Long |

## Historical Significance

The Moonlight Greatsword represents the legacy of Seath the Scaleless:
- Created from crystallized moonlight
- Gifted to those who served the paledrake
- Symbol of dragon transcendence
- Appears in every Souls game

## Synergies

### Sorcery Combinations

- **Homing Crystal Soulmass**: Setup into R2
- **Great Magic Shield**: Tank while charging R2

### Equipment Pairings
