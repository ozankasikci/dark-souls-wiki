# Claymore

The Claymore is widely considered one of the most versatile weapons in Dark Souls. Its exceptional moveset, reasonable stat requirements, and excellent scaling make it suitable for nearly any build.

## Acquisition

- Found on a corpse on the bridge in Undead Burg where the Hellkite Drake patrols
- Located on the left side of the bridge
- Can be retrieved by sprinting past the drake or baiting its fire breath

## Stats

| Stat | Value |
|------|-------|
| Physical Damage | 103 (base) |
| Weight | 6.0 |
| Durability | 200 |
| Strength Scaling | C |
| Dexterity Scaling | C |

## Requirements

| Stat | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| Strength | 16 |

## Why Choose the Claymore?

The Claymore has earned its reputation as one of the best greatswords:
- **Thrust R2 attack** - One-handed R2 is a long-range thrust (unique for greatswords)
- **Wide sweeping two-handed R1s** - Excellent for crowd control
- **True quality weapon** - 51% STR and 51% DEX scaling
- **Can be buffed** - Works with resins and magic buffs
- **Excellent for both PvE and PvP**

## Moveset

### One-Handed
- **R1**: Diagonal slashes with good speed
- **R2**: Long-range thrust (unique for greatswords)
- **Rolling R1**: Upward slash
- **Running R1**: Sweeping slash

### Two-Handed
- **R1**: Wide horizontal sweeps
- **R2**: Overhead slam
- **Rolling R1**: Quick thrust

## Build Recommendations

### Quality Build (27 STR / 40 DEX)
Best option for the Claymore. At +15 with quality stats, it achieves impressive damage while maintaining versatility.

### Elemental Paths
- **Lightning +5**: Good for low-stat builds (removes scaling)
- **Fire +10**: Another option for builds not investing in STR/DEX
- **Divine +10**: Useful for Faith builds, keeps enemies dead in Catacombs
- **Enchanted +5**: For Intelligence builds

## Upgrades

Standard upgrade path using Titanite:
- +0 to +5: Titanite Shards (Andre of Astora)
- +6 to +10: Large Titanite Shards (requires Large Ember)
- +11 to +14: Titanite Chunks
- +15: Titanite Slab

At +15: ~200 base damage before scaling

## PvP Applications

### Key Advantages
1. **Moveset Variety**: Keeps opponents guessing
2. **Thrust Attacks**: Counter-damage bonus with Leo Ring
3. **Spacing**: Thrust R2 outranges most weapons
4. **Roll Catching**: Wide swings catch panic rolls

## Notes

- Available very early in the game
- One of the most reliable weapons from start to finish
- Popular for both speedruns and casual playthroughs
- The thrust attack makes it unique among greatswords
- Low weight (6.0) for a greatsword allows flexibility in builds
