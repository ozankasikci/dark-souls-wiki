# Murky Hand Scythe

The Murky Hand Scythe is a deceptively powerful dagger that became infamous in PvP for its combination of quickstep, dark damage, and exceptional scaling. Despite its small size, it rivals many larger weapons in damage output.

## Why It's Overpowered

- Native **dark damage** with A/A INT/FTH scaling
- **Quickstep** weapon art on a high-damage weapon
- Dagger speed with greatsword damage
- Cannot be parried during quickstep
- Chip damage through shields

## Build Optimization

### Dark Build (SL 120)
- **VIG**: 35
- **END**: 35
- **ATT**: 14 (2 spell slots)
- **INT**: 30
- **FTH**: 30
- AR: ~400 (200 physical/200 dark)

### Pure INT or FTH (SL 120)
- **VIG**: 40
- **END**: 35
- **INT/FTH**: 60
- Crystal/Lightning infusion
- AR: ~380

## Quickstep Mechanics

### Invincibility Frames
- 16 i-frames during quickstep
- Costs minimal FP (5)
- Can chain quicksteps
- Maintains momentum

### Quickstep Techniques
1. **QS → R1**: Basic punish
2. **QS → QS → R1**: Gap closer
3. **QS through → Backstab**: Advanced
4. **QS → R2**: Surprise heavy

## PvP Dominance Era

### Pre-Nerf Glory
Originally even stronger:
- Higher base damage
- Better scaling
- Longer range
- Still top-tier post-nerf

### Current Meta Position
- A-tier dueling weapon
- S-tier invasion tool
- Counters passive play
- Shield pressure king

## Damage & Chip

### Shield Chip Calculation
| Shield Stability | Chip Damage |
|-----------------|-------------|
| 100 (Havel's) | ~50 |
| 65 (Medium) | ~120 |
| 45 (Small) | ~180 |

Dark damage partially bypasses shields

## Combat Applications

### Advantages
- Unpunishable with quickstep
- Massive damage for size
- Low stat requirements
- Fast attacks
- Elemental damage

### Disadvantages
- Very short range
- Low durability
- Requires aggressive play
- Weak to ranged attacks

## Counter Strategies

### How to Fight Against
1. **Maintain distance**: Outrange it
2. **Crossbows**: Punish quickstep
3. **Hyper armor**: Trade favorably
4. **Running attacks**: Catch recovery

### How to Use Effectively
1. **Aggressive pressure**: Never let up
2. **Mix-up timing**: Vary quicksteps
3. **Chip shields**: Force guard breaks
4. **Backstab fish**: QS behind enemies

## Scaling Comparison

| Infusion | 30/30 INT/FTH | 60 INT | 60 FTH |
|----------|---------------|---------|---------|
| Dark | 400 AR | 350 AR | 350 AR |
| Chaos | 395 AR | 340 AR | 340 AR |
| Crystal | 340 AR | 380 AR | 300 AR |
| Lightning | 340 AR | 300 AR | 380 AR |

## Historical Impact

### PvP Meta Shift
- Defined aggressive playstyle meta
- Forced players to adapt
- Popularized quickstep weapons
- Still tournament viable

### Lore Connections
- Murk = Deep corruption
- Small but deadly
- Hidden in the dregs
- Represents forgotten humanity

## Advanced Setups

### Spell Combinations
- **Tears of Denial**: Survive trades
- **Dark Blade**: Even more damage
- **Deep Protection**: All-around boost

### Ring Setup
1. **Prisoner's Chain**: Stats
2. **Ring of Favor +3**: HP/Stamina
3. **Hornet Ring**: Backstab damage
4. **Dark Clutch Ring**: +15% dark
