# Friede's Great Scythe

Sister Friede's signature weapon combines the grace of a scythe with devastating frost magic. This boss weapon features one of the most complex and stylish movesets in the game, with a weapon art that mirrors Friede's own combat techniques.

## Unique Properties

2. **L2 + R2**: Blackflame Dance
   - Multiple spinning attacks
   - Ends with frost explosion
   - 20 FP cost

- **INT**: 40
- **ATT**: 14 (for buffs)

### Pure DEX (SL 120)

## Damage Optimization

| Stats | Physical | Magic | Frost | Total |
|-------|----------|--------|--------|--------|
| 16/40/12 | 276 | 193 | 36 | 469 |
| 16/40/40 | 276 | 270 | 36 | 546 |
| 16/60/40 | 303 | 270 | 36 | 573 |

2. **Running R1 → L2+R2**: Gap closer
3. **R2 → L2+R1**: Frost setup
4. **Backstep → R1 → WA**: Spacing

### I-Frame Abuse
