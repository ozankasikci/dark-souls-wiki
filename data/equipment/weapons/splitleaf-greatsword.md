# Splitleaf Greatsword

Despite its name, the Splitleaf Greatsword is actually a halberd with one of the most devastating true combos in Dark Souls III. Its unique weapon art enables a guaranteed helicopter spin combo that can deal over 1000 damage.

## The Helicopter Combo

### True Combo Sequence
1. **R1**: Initial hit
2. **L2 + R1**: Wind Rush (guaranteed)
3. **R1**: Helicopter spin (guaranteed)

Total damage: 1000-1200 (depending on build)

## Why It's Broken

- **True combo** from a single R1
- Massive damage potential
- Wide area coverage
- Cannot be escaped once started
- Works on all enemy types

## Build Optimization

### Quality Build (SL 120)
- **VIG**: 35
- **END**: 40 (combo needs stamina)
- **STR**: 40
- **DEX**: 40
- **VIT**: 15+
- Refined +10: 545 AR

### Strength Build (SL 120)
- **VIG**: 40
- **END**: 40
- **STR**: 66
- **DEX**: 16 (minimum)
- Heavy +10: 550 AR

## Weapon Art - Wind Rush

### Mechanics
- Thrust with wind effect
- True combos into R1
- 20 FP cost
- Deceptive range
- Has hyperarmor

### Applications
- Guaranteed after any R1 hit
- Wake-up tool
- Roll catching
- Trading with hyperarmor

## PvP Impact

### Tournament Usage
- Banned in some tournaments
- One-combo potential
- Requires single mistake
- Defines spacing game

### Counter Play
- Never get hit by R1
- Maintain perfect spacing
- Use projectiles
- Crossbow interrupts

## Combo Damage Breakdown

| Hit | Damage | Total |
|-----|---------|--------|
| R1 | 380 | 380 |
| L2+R1 | 420 | 800 |
| R1 (spin) | 460 | 1260 |

*At 40/40 STR/DEX with Refined*

## Advanced Techniques

### Mix-ups
1. **R1 → R1**: Standard combo
2. **R1 → L2 → R2**: Alternative ender
3. **Running R1 → L2**: Catch rolls
4. **L2 solo**: Spacing tool

### Stamina Management
- Full combo: 95 stamina
- Need 40+ END
- Green Blossoms help
- Don't attempt without stamina

## Comparison with Halberds

| Halberd | AR | True Combo | Weight |

| Gundyr's | 540 | No | 13.0 |
