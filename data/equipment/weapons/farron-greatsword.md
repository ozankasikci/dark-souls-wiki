# Farron Greatsword

The Farron Greatsword is the signature weapon of the Abyss Watchers, featuring a unique moveset that combines ultra greatsword attacks with acrobatic dagger moves. Known for its distinctive "breakdancing" L1 attacks.

## Unique Moveset Features

- Comes with parrying dagger in off-hand
- L1 attacks include spins and ground slides
- Can parry with L2 while two-handing
- Unconventional fighting style
- All L1 attacks have evasion frames

## The Breakdance Combo

### L1 Chain
1. **First L1**: Low spinning sweep
2. **Second L1**: Rising spin attack
3. **Third L1**: Backward sliding thrust
4. **Fourth L1**: Forward launching spin

Each move has brief invincibility frames

## Build Recommendations

### DEX Focus (SL 120)
- **VIG**: 40
- **END**: 40 (L1 spam needs stamina)
- **STR**: 18 (minimum)
- **DEX**: 60-70
- **VIT**: 20+ (medium weight)

### Quality Hybrid (SL 120)
- **VIG**: 35
- **END**: 35
- **STR**: 30
- **DEX**: 40
- **VIT**: 25

## Combat Applications

### PvE Advantages
- L1 dodges many boss attacks
- Wide sweeping attacks hit groups
- Parry option for humanoid enemies
- Low stamina cost per swing
- Stylish and fun to use

### PvP Considerations
**Strengths:**
- Unpredictable movement
- Mix-up potential
- Can dodge while attacking
- Parry catches aggressive players

**Weaknesses:**
- Predictable once learned
- Vulnerable during animations
- Lower damage than other UGS
- Easy to backstab

## Advanced Techniques

### Animation Canceling
- L1 → Roll (cancel recovery)
- R1 → L1 (standard into spin)
- L2 → R1 (parry bait into attack)

### Spacing Tricks
- Third L1 creates distance
- Fourth L1 closes gaps
- Use terrain for slide attacks
- Wall combos possible

## Damage & Scaling

| Level | Physical | DEX Scaling |

| +0 | 141 | A |
| +1 | 165 | A |
| +2 | 188 | A |
| +3 | 212 | A |
| +4 | 235 | A |
| +5 | 259 | A |

## Lore & Significance

### Abyss Watcher Legacy
- Modified Artorias fighting style
- Adapted for fighting in groups
- Dagger represents fallen comrades
- Self-taught Wolf Blood techniques

### Design Philosophy
- Speed over power
- Mobility over defense
- Pack hunting tactics
- Eternal vigilance against abyss
