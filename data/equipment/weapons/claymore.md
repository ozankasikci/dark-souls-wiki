# Claymore

The Claymore is widely considered one of the most versatile weapons in Dark Souls III. Its exceptional moveset, reasonable stat requirements, and excellent scaling make it suitable for nearly any build.

## Why Choose the Claymore?

The Claymore has earned its reputation as "Old Reliable" for several reasons:
- Thrust attacks on one-handed R2
- Wide sweeping two-handed R1s
- Stance weapon art for versatility
- Excellent for both PvE and PvP
- Can be buffed and infused

## Comprehensive Moveset

### One-Handed
- **R1**: Diagonal slashes with good speed
- **R2**: Long-range thrust (unique for greatswords)
- **Rolling R1**: Upward slash
- **Running R1**: Sweeping slash

### Two-Handed
- **R1**: Wide horizontal sweeps
- **R2**: Overhead slam
- **Rolling R1**: Quick thrust
- **Weapon Art (Stance)**: 
  - R1: Guard break
  - R2: Launching uppercut

## Build Optimization Guide

### Quality Build (40/40 STR/DEX)
- Refined infusion
- ~525 AR at +10
- Most versatile option

### Strength Build (66 STR)
- Heavy infusion
- ~545 AR when two-handed
- Maximizes hyperarmor potential

### Dexterity Build (70 DEX)
- Sharp infusion
- ~490 AR at +10
- Faster casting for hybrid builds

### Elemental Builds
- **Dark/Chaos**: Excellent for pyromancers
- **Crystal**: Strong for INT builds
- **Lightning**: Viable for faith builds
- **Blessed**: Decent damage with HP regen

## PvP Mastery

### Key Advantages
1. **Moveset Variety**: Keeps opponents guessing
2. **Thrust Attacks**: Counter-damage bonus
3. **Hyperarmor**: Trades with smaller weapons
4. **Roll Catching**: Wide swings catch rolls
5. **Stance Mix-ups**: R1 breaks guards, R2 launches

### Essential Combos
- 2H R1 → R1 (basic combo)
- 1H R2 → R1 (thrust into slash)
- Stance R2 → R1 (launch combo)
- Running R1 → R2 (mix-up)

### Advanced Techniques

#### The Thrust Game
Master the one-handed R2 thrust:
- Outranges most straight swords
- Benefits from Leo Ring counter damage
- Catches backward rolls
- Safe poke option

#### Stance Dancing
Use Stance to create pressure:
- Condition with R1 guard breaks
- Punish with R2 launches
- Cancel into rolls for safety

## PvE Applications

The Claymore excels in PvE content:
- **Crowd Control**: Wide swings handle groups
- **Boss Fighting**: Thrust for safety, slashes for damage
- **Versatility**: Effective against all enemy types
- **Stamina Efficient**: Good damage per stamina point

## Tips for Success

1. **Learn All Attacks**: Each has specific uses
2. **Spacing**: Use thrust R2 to control distance
3. **Stamina Management**: Keep enough for rolls
4. **Mix Up Attacks**: Predictability is death
5. **Use Hyperarmor**: Trade when advantageous

The Claymore remains one of the most reliable weapons throughout the entire game, from early areas to end-game PvP.
