# Dragonslayer Greataxe

The Dragonslayer Greataxe is the heaviest hitting weapon in its class, boasting the highest AR (Attack Rating) potential in the game. This massive weapon combines devastating physical damage with innate lightning damage.

## Weapon Art - Falling Bolt

The signature move that defines this weapon:
- Calls down lightning bolt on impact
- AOE damage in addition to direct hit
- Can hit for 1000+ damage on counter hits
- Costs 25 FP per use
- Has hyper armor throughout animation

## Build Optimization

### Pure Strength (Recommended)
- **STR**: 66 (99 when two-handing)
- **VIT**: 40+ (to manage weight)
- **END**: 40 (heavy attacks drain stamina)
- **VIG**: 40 (standard)

### Rings
1. **Havel's Ring +3**: Weight management
2. **Ring of Favor +3**: All-around stats
3. **Lightning Clutch Ring**: +15% lightning damage
4. **Chloranthy Ring +3**: Stamina regeneration

## Damage Calculations

### Attack Rating at 66 STR
- Physical: 729
- Lightning: 74
- **Total AR**: 803 (two-handed)

### With Buffs
- Sacred Oath: +10% AR
- Deep Protection: +5% AR
- Power Within: +20% AR (risky)
- **Theoretical Max**: ~1000 AR

## Combat Applications

### PvE Dominance
One-shots or two-shots most enemies:
- Charged R2 can hit for 1500+ damage
- Weapon Art decimates large enemies
- Breaks poise on everything
- Staggers bosses quickly

### PvP Considerations
**Strengths:**
- Hyper armor on all attacks
- Massive damage punishes mistakes
- Weapon Art catches rolls
- Intimidation factor

**Weaknesses:**
- Extremely slow
- Predictable moveset
- High stamina consumption
- Easy to backstab

## Moveset Analysis

| Attack | Damage | Speed | Stamina | Notes |
|--------|--------|--------|----------|--------|
| R1 | 100% | Slow | High | Horizontal sweep |
| R2 | 140% | Very Slow | Very High | Overhead slam |
| Rolling R1 | 85% | Medium | Medium | Upward swing |
| Weapon Art | 200%+ | Slow | Medium | AOE lightning |

## Historical Context

Created to hunt ancient dragons:
- Melted and reformed countless times
- Lightning mimics dragons' weakness
- Wielded by automated armor
- Symbol of mankind's defiance

## Combo Potential

### True Combos
- R1 → R1 (if first hit connects)
- Rolling R1 → R1 (situational)
- No guaranteed Weapon Art combos

### Mix-ups
- R1 → Delayed R1 (catch rolls)
- R2 → Weapon Art (area denial)
- Sprint → R1 → R2 (stamina intensive)
