# Giant's Halberd

## Overview
The Giant's Halberd is a massive polearm wielded by Anor Londo's sentinels, featuring inherent lightning damage that reflects its divine origins. This colossal weapon trades weight for incredible base damage and reach.

## Characteristics

### Advantages
- **Dual Damage**: 140 physical + 140 lightning
- **Massive Reach**: Longest halberd range
- **High Base Damage**: 280 total AR
- **Lightning Property**: Effective vs many enemies
- **Intimidating Size**: Psychological factor

### Disadvantages
- **Extremely Heavy**: 16.0 weight units
- **High Requirements**: 36 STR needed
- **Split Damage**: Two defense checks
- **Cannot Be Buffed**: No enhancement
- **Poor Scaling**: Only D/D

## Location
Dropped by **Giant Sentinels** in Anor Londo:
- Large halberd-wielding giants
- Found throughout the city
- Low drop rate
- Use item discovery gear
- Respawn at bonfire

## Best Practices

### Builds
The Giant's Halberd requires:
- **High STR**: 36 minimum
- **Heavy Build**: Weight management
- **Tank Builds**: Trade mobility for power
- **Giant Cosplay**: Full sentinel set

### Split Damage Reality
140/140 means:
- Reduced by physical defense
- Reduced by lightning defense
- Often less than 280 total
- Still very high output
- Effective vs low defense

### Combat Tips
1. Two-hand for 24 STR requirement
2. Abuse the incredible reach
3. R2 has massive hitbox
4. Lightning effective in water
5. Spacing is crucial

## Size Matters
The weapon is:
- Visibly larger than other halberds
- Longer reach than any halberd
- Wider attack arcs
- Can hit over obstacles
- Intimidating in PvP

## Farming Strategy
Best approach:
1. Royal Wood has many sentinels
2. Use Gold Serpent Ring
3. 10 soft humanity
4. Symbol of Avarice (risky)
5. Multiple sentinels per run

## Comparison to Other Halberds
- **vs Regular Halberds**: Much heavier, more damage
- **vs Black Knight Halberd**: Similar concept
- **Weight Class**: Almost a great weapon
- **Unique Properties**: Lightning damage

## Giant Build Theme
Complete the look:
- Giant's Halberd
- Giant's Armor set
- Giant's Shield
- Havel's Ring necessity
- Become the sentinel

## PvP Considerations
- Reach advantage massive
- Weight limits build
- Lightning catches some off-guard
- Cannot buff disadvantage
- Intimidation factor real

## Effective Situations
Lightning damage helps vs:
- Dragons (ironic)
- Most armored enemies
- Water areas
- PvP metal armor
- Demon enemies

## Fashion Statement
- Largest halberd model
- Lightning effects visible
- Giant sentinel aesthetic
- Size impresses/terrifies
- Trophy weapon status

## Notes
- Can hit enemies other halberds miss
- The R2 slam has AOE properties
- Weight almost requires FAP ring
- Represents Anor Londo's might
