# Gargoyle's Halberd

## Overview
The Gargoyle's Halberd is a unique polearm dropped by the Bell Gargoyles, featuring an all-slash moveset and built-in resistance bonuses. Its stone construction provides protection against status ailments while maintaining competitive damage.

## Characteristics

### Advantages
- **Status Resistance**: +20% to all ailments
- **Longer Reach**: Than regular Halberd
- **Higher Base Damage**: 115 vs 110
- **All Slash Moveset**: More consistent
- **Utility Bonus**: Passive resistances

### Disadvantages
- **Cannot Be Buffed**: No resins/spells
- **No Thrust Attacks**: Less versatile
- **Rare Drop**: From gargoyles
- **Split D/D Scaling**: Not specialized

## Location
Two acquisition methods:
1. **Bell Gargoyles Boss**: 
   - Chance to drop from boss
   - Not guaranteed
   - One chance per playthrough

2. **Anor Londo Gargoyles**:
   - Lightning gargoyles
   - Better drop rate
   - Can farm repeatedly
   - Dangerous enemies

## Best Practices

### Builds
The Gargoyle's Halberd suits:
- **Quality Builds**: D/D scaling
- **Status-Heavy Areas**: Blighttown, etc.
- **Reach-Focused**: Longer than normal
- **Utility Builds**: Passive bonuses

### Status Resistance
+20% resistance to:
- Poison buildup
- Toxic buildup
- Bleed buildup
- Curse buildup
Always active when equipped

### Combat Tips
1. All attacks are sweeps
2. Excellent crowd control
3. Two-hand for better scaling
4. Wide arcs catch rolls
5. No thrust for narrow spaces

## Moveset Differences
vs Regular Halberd:
- No thrust attacks
- All horizontal sweeps
- More predictable
- Better for groups
- Worse in corridors

## Farming Strategy
Anor Londo method:
1. Kill all but one gargoyle
2. Farm the survivor
3. Use Gold Serpent Ring
4. 10 humanity recommended
5. Reset at bonfire

## Comparison to Other Halberds
- **vs Halberd**: More reach, no thrust
- **vs Scythe**: Traditional halberd moveset
- **vs Lucerne**: No unique attacks
- **Defensive Option**: Only with resistances

## Utility Applications
Excellent for:
- Blighttown exploration
- Painted World (toxic)
- New Londo (ghosts)
- PvP vs bleed builds
- Curse-heavy areas

## PvP Considerations
- Resistance bonus always helps
- Wide sweeps control space
- No thrust limits options
- Cannot buff disadvantage
- Reach advantage significant

## Fashion Souls
Stone aesthetic pairs with:
- Stone armor sets
- Gargoyle Helm
- Guardian armor
- Havel's set theme

## Speedrun Usage
- RNG dependent drop
- Good if obtained early
- Resistances help survival
- Not reliable route

## Notes
- The resistance bonus stacks with rings
- Model is noticeably longer
- Cannot buff is major limitation
- Represents gargoyle's stone nature
