# Halberd

## Overview
The Halberd is the quintessential polearm of Dark Souls, combining the reach of a spear with the cutting power of an axe. This versatile weapon offers a mixed moveset of thrusts and sweeps, making it effective in various combat situations.

## Characteristics

### Advantages
- **Long Reach**: Excellent range for safety
- **Mixed Damage**: Thrust and slash attacks
- **Versatile Moveset**: Adapts to situations
- **Early Availability**: Found in Undead Parish
- **Good Base Damage**: 110 physical

### Disadvantages
- **Split Moveset**: Can be unpredictable
- **Moderate Scaling**: D/C isn't exceptional
- **Dead Angles**: Sweet spot mechanics
- **Stamina Hungry**: Heavy attacks drain stamina

## Location
Found in **Undead Parish**:
- Near the gate lever to Darkroot
- On a corpse by the gate
- Can rush early with Master Key
- Also dropped by halberd hollows

## Best Practices

### Builds
The Halberd works well in:
- **Quality Builds**: Benefits from STR/DEX
- **Reach Builds**: Maximize spacing
- **Early Game**: Strong starter weapon
- **Speedrun Routes**: Consistent damage

### Upgrade Paths
- **Standard +15**: Best for scaling builds
- **Lightning/Fire +10**: Excellent base damage
- **Crystal +5**: Maximum damage output
- **Divine +10**: For Catacombs runs

### Combat Tips
1. Master the sweet spot distance
2. R1 alternates thrust/sweep
3. Two-hand changes moveset entirely
4. Running R1 has wide coverage
5. Can hit through some walls

## Moveset Mastery
Understanding attacks:
- **1H R1**: Thrust → Sweep → Repeat
- **2H R1**: All overhead chops
- **Running R1**: Wide spinning slash
- **R2 Attacks**: Powerful but slow
- **Dead Angle**: Hits around shields

## Speedrun Weapon
