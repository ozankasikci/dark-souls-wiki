# Claw

## Overview
The Claw is a vicious fist weapon designed for inflicting bleeding wounds rather than blunt trauma. Favored by assassins and shadow warriors, these bladed gauntlets trade the Caestus's utility for deadly bleeding potential.

## Characteristics

### Advantages
- **High Bleed**: 300 buildup per hit
- **Dexterity Scaling**: B-rank, becomes A
- **Slash Damage**: Different properties than fists
- **Fast Attacks**: Rapid bleed application
- **Low Weight**: Only 1.0 unit

### Disadvantages
- **Cannot Parry**: No defensive utility
- **Low Durability**: Only 150
- **Higher Requirements**: Needs 14 DEX
- **Expensive**: 5000 souls from Shiva

## Location
- Sold by **Shiva of the East** in Blighttown
- Requires **Forest Hunter Covenant** membership
- Found near the water wheel
- 5000 souls per Claw
- Can buy two for dual-wielding

## Best Practices

### Builds
The Claw excels in:
- **DEX/Bleed Builds**: Maximizes both aspects
- **Ninja Cosplay**: Shadow warrior themes
- **Dual Claw Builds**: Maximum bleed pressure
- **Critical Builds**: High DEX for backstabs

### Upgrade Paths
- **Standard +15**: Best for DEX builds (A-scaling)
- **Crystal +5**: Maximum damage, no repair
- **Lightning/Fire**: Removes bleed effect
- **Never Raw**: Ruins the scaling

### Combat Tips
1. Focus on rapid hits for bleed
2. Strong attack has good reach
3. Dual claws for maximum effect
4. Target unarmored enemies
5. Bleed works on most bosses

## Bleed Mechanics
- 300 bleed per hit is significant
- Most enemies: 2-3 hits to proc
- Bleed deals 30-50% max HP
- Stacks with other bleed sources
- Ineffective on undead/demons

## Dual Claw Build
The "Wolverine" setup:
- Two Claws for L1/R1 combos
- Rapid bleed buildup
- Shadow armor set synergy
- Ring of Favor for stamina
- Bloodbite Ring ironically

## Comparison to Other Fist Weapons
- **vs Caestus**: Bleed but no parry
- **vs Dragon Bone Fist**: Faster, has bleed
- **vs Dark Hand**: More reliable damage
- **Unique Role**: Only bleed fist weapon

## PvP Applications
- Bleed pressure in close combat
- Roll catching potential
- Anti-turtle strategy
- Pairs with throwing knives
- Psychological warfare

## Covenant Requirement
Forest Hunter membership:
- Must not betray covenant
- Shiva appears after joining
- Can leave after purchase
- Plan covenant order carefully

## Fashion and Theme
Perfect with:
- Shadow armor set
- Ninja themes
- Assassin builds
- Eastern armor sets

## Notable Combos
- Claw + Bloodbite Ring
- Dual Claw bleed rush
- Claw + Uchigatana swap
- Shadow set invisibility

## Notes
- Attack animations are unique
- Cannot backstab or riposte
- Bleed builds up even on blocks
- The "shink" sound effect is satisfying
