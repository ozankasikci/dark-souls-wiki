# Dark Hand

## Overview
The Dark Hand is one of Dark Souls' most unique items, functioning as a weapon, shield, and humanity-stealing tool all in one. This mysterious artifact of the Darkwraiths has fixed damage but offers utility no other weapon can match.

## Characteristics

### Advantages
- **Fixed 200 Damage**: No stats required
- **Weighs Nothing**: 0.0 weight
- **Shield Function**: 80% all resistances
- **Humanity Drain**: Unique R2 ability
- **No Requirements**: Anyone can use

### Disadvantages
- **Cannot Upgrade**: Stuck at 200 damage
- **No Scaling**: Never improves
- **Short Range**: Even for fist weapon
- **Grab is Slow**: R2 easily dodged
- **Limited Acquisition**: Covenant or rare drop

## Location
Two methods of acquisition:
1. **Join Darkwraith Covenant**:
   - Defeat Four Kings
   - Talk to Darkstalker Kaathe
   - Join covenant for free Dark Hand
   
2. **Farm Darkwraiths**:
   - New Londo Ruins (lower)
   - Very rare drop
   - Need Covetous Gold Serpent Ring

## Best Practices

### Unique Functions
The Dark Hand offers:
- **Right Hand**: 200 damage weapon
- **Left Hand**: 80% reduction shield
- **R2 Attack**: Steals humanity
- **Dual Purpose**: Weapon and shield
- **Zero Weight**: Perfect backup

### Humanity Drain
The R2 grab attack:
- Steals humanity from humans
- Works on NPCs (once each)
- Works on players in PvP
- Very slow and obvious
- High risk, high reward

### Combat Tips
1. 200 damage is decent early game
2. Shield function in left hand
3. R2 only on predictable enemies
4. Good for low-level runs
5. Humanity farm potential

## Shield Properties
When in left hand:
- 80% physical reduction
- 80% magic reduction
- 80% fire reduction  
- 80% lightning reduction
- 30 stability (low)
- Weighs nothing

## PvP Applications
- Surprise shield in left hand
- Humanity steal humiliation
- No weight backup option
- Low-level invasion tool
- Mind games potential

## Darkwraith Role-Play
Complete Darkwraith setup:
- Dark Hand
- Dark Armor set
- Red Eye Orb invasions
- Humanity hoarding
- Embrace the darkness

## Comparison to Other Fists
- **vs Caestus**: Fixed damage, no scaling
- **vs Claw**: No bleed, no upgrade
- **vs Dragon Bone**: Less damage, more utility
- **Unique Role**: Only humanity-stealing weapon

## Low-Level Usage
Perfect for:
- SL1 runs (200 damage significant)
- Early game before scaling matters
- Backup weapon/shield
- Humanity farming
- Twink invasions

## NPC Humanity Drain
Can drain from:
- Most human NPCs (once only)
- Yields 1 humanity per NPC
- Doesn't kill or aggro them
- Unique source of humanity
- Plan route for maximum gain

## Notes
- The shield visual effect is unique
- Cannot parry despite shield function
- Popular in "no upgrade" runs
- Represents the abyss's corruption
