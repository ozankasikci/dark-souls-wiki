# Silver Knight Straight Sword

The silver knights of Anor Londo guard the city using this beautifully slender weapon. Its chain attacks, in which the wielder takes continuous short steps forward while swinging the blade, are deadly.

## Acquisition
- Dropped by sword-wielding Silver Knights in Anor Londo (1% drop rate)
- Best farmed from the two knights near the bonfire
- Use Gold Serpent Ring and humanity for better drop rates

## Characteristics
This elegant weapon features excellent reach for a straight sword and has the hidden blessed property, dealing bonus damage to skeletons and preventing them from reviving.

**Moveset:**
- One-handed R1: Elegant diagonal slashes
- One-handed R2: Forward thrust with step
- Two-handed R1: Wide horizontal swings
- Two-handed R2: Lunging thrust
- Chain R1 attacks: Unique forward-stepping combo

**Special Properties:**
- 110% damage against reanimated enemies
- Prevents skeleton revival (like divine weapons)
- Longer reach than most straight swords
