# Sunlight Straight Sword

This standard longsword, belonging to Solaire of Astora, is of high quality, is well-forged, and has been kept in good repair. Easy to use and dependable, but unlikely to live up to its grandiose name.

## Acquisition
- Dropped by Solaire of Astora when killed
- Can be obtained by saving him and letting him go hollow in Lost Izalith
- If you kill the Sunlight Maggot before Solaire reaches it, he survives his questline
- Killing Solaire early prevents his summon sign at various bosses

## Characteristics
Despite its legendary association with Solaire, the Sunlight Straight Sword is functionally a slightly improved Longsword with no special magical properties. Solaire's power comes from his faith and skill, not his equipment.

**Moveset:**
- One-handed R1: Standard straight sword horizontal slashes
- One-handed R2: Thrust attack
- Two-handed R1: Vertical and horizontal slashes
- Two-handed R2: Strong thrust

**Comparison to Longsword:**
- +2 base damage
- +60 durability (240 vs 180)
- +1.0 weight
- Higher STR/DEX requirements (12/12 vs 10/10)
- Slightly slower attack speed

## Upgrades
Standard upgrade paths available:
- **Normal +15**: Best for quality builds (C/C scaling)
- **Lightning +5**: No scaling, high base damage
- **Divine +10**: Faith scaling for cleric builds
- **Fire/Chaos +5**: Removes scaling
- Can be buffed when on normal upgrade path

## Notes
- No special properties despite its name
- "Unlikely to live up to its grandiose name" per item description
- Solaire's strength comes from his skills, not equipment
- Popular for Solaire cosplay builds
- Killing Solaire too early means missing his summon help at bosses
- "Praise the Sun!" \\[T]/

## Lore
The sword's description emphasizes that Solaire's legendary status comes from his personal faith and dedication to the sun, not from any magical enhancement to his gear. This humble blade has served him faithfully across multiple worlds as he searches for his own sun.
