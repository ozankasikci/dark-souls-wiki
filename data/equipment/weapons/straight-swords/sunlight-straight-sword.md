# Sunlight Straight Sword

This standard longsword, belonging to Solaire of Astora, is of high quality, is well-forged, and has been kept in good repair. Easy to use and dependable, but unlikely to live up to its grandiose name.

## Acquisition
- Dropped by Solaire of Astora when killed
- Can be obtained by completing his questline (he goes hollow)
- Not recommended to kill Solaire early as you miss his questline

## Characteristics
The Sunlight Straight Sword is unique among straight swords for its faith scaling and built-in miracle buff. The two-handed R2 casts a version of Sacred Oath that boosts damage and damage reduction.

**Moveset:**
- One-handed R1: Standard straight sword slashes
- One-handed R2: Thrust attack
- Two-handed R1: Vertical and horizontal slashes
- Two-handed R2: Casts Sacred Oath buff (costs no FP/casts)

**Buff Effect:**
- +10% physical damage
- +10% damage absorption
- Duration: 60 seconds
- Stacks with other buffs

## Upgrades
Upgraded with Twinkling Titanite:
- Sunlight Straight Sword +1 (1 Twinkling Titanite)
- +1 → +2 (1 Twinkling Titanite)
- +2 → +3 (2 Twinkling Titanite)
- +3 → +4 (2 Twinkling Titanite)
- +4 → +5 (4 Twinkling Titanite)

## Notes
- Popular for faith builds due to B faith scaling
- Built-in buff makes it useful for any build
- Cannot be infused or buffed with resins/spells
- Killing Solaire prevents joining Warriors of Sunlight
- "Praise the Sun!" \\[T]/
