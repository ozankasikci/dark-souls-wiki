- Dropped by Undead Soldiers (sword and shield type) - 2% drop rate

| Weight | 3.0 |
| Durability | 200 |
| Strength Scaling | C |

## Requirements

| Stat | Requirement |

- **One-handed R2**: Upward thrust
- **Two-handed R1**: Vertical slashes
- **Two-handed R2**: Strong thrust with good reach

## Build Recommendations

### Quality Build
With C/C scaling in STR/DEX, the Longsword excels in quality builds. At +15 with 40 STR/40 DEX, it reaches impressive damage output while maintaining its versatile moveset.

### Elemental Paths
The Longsword performs well with various upgrade paths:
- **Lightning +5**: Good for low-stat builds (no scaling)
- **Fire +10**: Another option for builds not investing in STR/DEX
- **Divine +10**: Useful for Faith builds
- **Enchanted +5**: For Intelligence builds

## Upgrades

Standard upgrade path using Titanite:
- +0 to +5: Titanite Shards
- +6 to +10: Large Titanite Shards
- +11 to +14: Titanite Chunks
- +15: Titanite Slab

At +15: ~200 base damage before scaling

## Notes

- One of the most reliable weapons in the game
- Completely viable from start to finish
- Low weight makes it easy to incorporate into any build
- Popular for both PvE and PvP
- Standard moveset that feels natural for new players
