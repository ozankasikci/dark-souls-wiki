# Broken Straight Sword

Half of a broken straight sword. Use of this scant-damaged weapon will require a certain degree of skill.

## Acquisition
- Common drop from Hollow Warriors throughout Lordran
- Found on various corpses
- Very high drop rate from basic Hollows

## Characteristics
The Broken Straight Sword has half the reach of a normal straight sword but retains the moveset. Popular for challenge runs.

**Moveset:**
- Standard straight sword moveset
- One-handed R1: Quick slashes
- One-handed R2: Thrust
- Two-handed R1: Heavier slashes
- Two-handed R2: Guard break thrust

**Special Properties:**
- Half the range of normal swords
- Very low durability
- Surprisingly decent when upgraded
- Can be buffed

## Upgrades
Standard upgrade paths available:
- Normal +15: Becomes surprisingly viable
- Lightning +5: Good for SL1 runs
- Fire/Chaos +5: Decent elemental option
- Raw +5: For very low stats

## Notes
- Popular challenge run weapon
- "Broken Sword Run" tests player skill
- Can complete entire game with it
- Better scaling than Straight Sword Hilt
- Short range requires aggressive play
