# Crystal Straight Sword

Straight sword forged from crystal. These weapons are difficult to wield properly, and their blade cannot be repaired once worn.

## Acquisition
- Sold by Domhnall of Zena for 4,000 souls
- Domhnall locations:
  - Initially under bridge in Depths
  - Later at Firelink Shrine (after Blighttown)
- Cannot be obtained elsewhere

## Characteristics
The Crystal Straight Sword has higher base damage than regular straight swords but cannot be repaired, making it a temporary weapon.

**Moveset:**
- Identical to Longsword
- One-handed R1: Horizontal slashes
- One-handed R2: Thrust
- Two-handed R1: Vertical slashes
- Two-handed R2: Guard-breaking thrust

**Special Properties:**
- Cannot be repaired by any means
- Cannot be upgraded
- 30% higher base damage than Longsword
- Very low durability (60)

## Upgrades
Cannot be upgraded or modified in any way.

## Notes
- Use sparingly due to no repair
- Good for speedruns
- Dispose after it breaks
- Not worth the souls for most players
- Crystal weapons introduced by Seath
- Example of risk/reward weapon design
