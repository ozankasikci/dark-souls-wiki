# Drake Sword

This sword, one of the rare dragon weapons, is obtained by cutting the tail of the Hellkite Dragon (also known as the Bridge Wyvern) that guards the bridge in Undead Burg. Despite its dragon origins, it has no stat scaling.

## Acquisition
- Obtained by cutting off the Hellkite Dragon's tail on the bridge in Undead Burg
- Shoot the tail with ~28 arrows from under the bridge
- Or cut it directly in melee (dangerous)
- Does NOT respawn if you kill the dragon without cutting tail

## Characteristics
The Drake Sword is infamous as the "noob trap" weapon. While extremely powerful early game with 200 base damage, it has no stat scaling and quickly becomes obsolete. Many new players rely on it too long and struggle later.

**Moveset:**
- One-handed R1: Vertical slashes
- One-handed R2: Projectile attack (30 durability cost)
- Two-handed R1: Horizontal slashes  
- Two-handed R2: AOE shockwave (30 durability cost)

**Special Attacks:**
- R2 attacks consume 30 durability per use
- Cannot be repaired at bonfires, needs Repair Powder or blacksmith
- Special attacks have limited range

## Upgrades
Requires Dragon Scales (very rare):
- Drake Sword → Drake Sword +1 (1 Dragon Scale) - 210 damage
- +1 → +2 (1 Dragon Scale) - 220 damage
- +2 → +3 (2 Dragon Scales) - 230 damage
- +3 → +4 (2 Dragon Scales) - 240 damage
- +4 → +5 (4 Dragon Scales) - 260 damage

## Notes
- Often called the "noob trap" weapon
- No scaling means it's outclassed by mid-game
- Expensive to repair (5000 souls at blacksmith)
- R2 attacks drain durability rapidly
- Better to learn weapon scaling early
- Not recommended for experienced players
