# Barbed Straight Sword

Straight sword with countless thorns. Held by Knight Kirk of Thorns. Causes heavy bleeding.

## Acquisition
- Dropped by Knight Kirk (Darkwraith)
- Kirk invades in three locations:
  - Depths (near Basilisk area)
  - Demon Ruins (before Demon Firesage)
  - Lost Izalith (near Bed of Chaos)
- Must be killed in all 3 locations for armor set

## Characteristics
The Barbed Straight Sword is one of the few straight swords with bleed buildup, making it unique for the weapon class.

**Moveset:**
- Standard straight sword moveset
- One-handed R1: Horizontal slashes
- One-handed R2: Thrust attack
- Two-handed R1: Vertical slashes
- Two-handed R2: Thrust with knockback

**Special Properties:**
- 300 bleed buildup (high for straight sword)
- Lower durability than most
- Kirk's signature weapon
- Pairs with Armor of Thorns

## Upgrades
- Normal +15: Maintains bleed effect
- Lightning/Fire +5: Loses bleed buildup
- Chaos +5: Fire damage but no bleed
- Raw +5: Keeps bleed, higher base damage

## Notes
- Bleed works well in PvP
- Kirk is a recurring invader
- Killing him yields humanity
- Full Kirk set has thorn damage
- Good for bleed-focused builds
