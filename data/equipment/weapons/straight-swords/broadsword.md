# Broadsword

A straight sword with a broad blade designed for slashing. A widely-used standard straight sword. Inflicts reliable standard damage, and can be brandished with ease.

## Acquisition
- Starting equipment for Knight class
- Sold by Andre of Astora for 1,000 souls
- Found on various hollow soldiers throughout Lordran

## Characteristics
The Broadsword features wide horizontal swings that make it excellent for dealing with multiple enemies. While it lacks the thrust attacks of other straight swords, its slashing moveset and decent base damage make it a solid choice for strength builds.

**Moveset:**
- One-handed R1: Horizontal slashes
- One-handed R2: Overhead slam
- Two-handed R1: Wide horizontal swings
- Two-handed R2: Thrust attack

## Upgrades
- **Normal +15**: Balanced scaling for quality builds
- **Raw +5**: Good early game option
- **Divine +10**: For Catacombs and Nito fight
- **Fire/Chaos +5**: Removes scaling but adds fire damage

## Notes
- Higher base damage than Longsword but worse scaling
- No thrust attacks in one-handed moveset
- Good starter weapon but often replaced later
- Wide swings can hit walls in narrow corridors
