# Straight Sword Hilt

A straight sword with a broken blade. The weak blade is impossible to use for attacks, but can serve as a last resort.

## Acquisition
- Starting equipment for Thief class
- Found on corpse in Northern Undead Asylum
- Dropped rarely by Hollow Warriors

## Characteristics
The Straight Sword Hilt is essentially a broken weapon with minimal damage output. Only useful as an absolute last resort or for challenge runs.

**Moveset:**
- One-handed R1: Weak slashes
- One-handed R2: Thrust
- Two-handed R1: Slightly stronger slashes
- Two-handed R2: Forward thrust

**Special Properties:**
- Extremely low base damage
- Very light weight
- Can still be upgraded
- Popular for challenge runs

## Upgrades
Despite being broken, can follow standard upgrade paths:
- Normal +15: Still weak but usable
- Raw +5: Slight damage boost
- Lightning +5: Best for low stats
- Fire/Chaos +5: Adds elemental damage

## Notes
- Primarily a joke/challenge weapon
- "Broken Straight Sword" run is a popular challenge
- Can backstab/riposte normally
- Upgrade it for memes
- Better than bare fists
