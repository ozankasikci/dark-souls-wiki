# Estoc

The Estoc is the longest thrusting sword in Dark Souls III, notorious for its exceptional range and shield-piercing capabilities. Often controversial in PvP, the Estoc remains one of the most effective weapons for patient, defensive players.

## Weapon Overview

What makes the Estoc special:
- Longest reach among thrusting swords
- All attacks are thrusts (100% thrust damage)
- Shield Splitter weapon art ignores shields
- Can attack while blocking with shield up
- Low stamina consumption

## Detailed Moveset

### Core Attacks
- **R1**: Quick forward thrust
- **R2**: Longer wind-up thrust with more range
- **Running R1**: Long-range running poke
- **Rolling R1**: Quick thrust out of roll
- **Shield Poke**: R1 while blocking

### Weapon Art: Shield Splitter
A powerful thrust that:
- Ignores shield defense
- Deals significant stamina damage
- Has deceptive range
- Can guard break turtling opponents

## Build Recommendations

### Sharp Dexterity (60-80 DEX)
- Sharp infusion for maximum damage
- ~340 AR at 80 DEX
- Maintains ability to be buffed

### Quality Build (40/40)
- Refined infusion
- ~365 AR
- More stat investment for minimal gain

### Elemental Options
- **Crystal**: For INT builds
- **Lightning**: Faith builds (moderate)
- **Raw**: Early game before scaling stats

### Turtle Build
- Pair with greatshield
- High stamina and stability
- Poke from behind shield
- Frustrating but effective

## PvP Analysis

### Strengths
1. **Unparalleled Reach**: Outranges most weapons
2. **Safety**: Attack from behind shield
3. **Counter Damage**: Leo Ring synergy
4. **Stamina Efficiency**: Many attacks per bar
5. **Roll Catching**: Excellent tracking

### Weaknesses
1. **Predictable**: Only thrust attacks
2. **Low Damage**: Requires many hits
3. **No Hyperarmor**: Easily interrupted
4. **Narrow Hitbox**: Can miss sidestepping opponents
5. **Reputation**: Often considered "cheap"

## Advanced Strategies

### The Reactive Playstyle
- Wait for opponent mistakes
- Punish whiffs with R1
- Control space with range
- Never overcommit

### Shield Pressure
1. Block with greatshield
2. R1 poke when safe
3. Shield Splitter when they turtle
4. Back away and repeat

### Mix-up Options
- Vary R1 and R2 timing
- Backstep → R1 for spacing
- Running R1 from unexpected angles
- Weapon art to catch shields

## Counter Strategies

For those facing Estoc users:
- **Hyperarmor**: Trade with larger weapons
- **Parrying**: R1 spam is parryable
- **Spacing**: Stay outside range
- **Aggression**: Don't let them dictate pace
- **Dead Angles**: Attack from sides

## Synergistic Equipment

### Shields
- **Black Knight Shield**: High stability
- **Lothric Knight Shield**: 100% physical, parry
- **Shield of Want**: Soul farming

### Rings
- **Leo Ring**: Essential for counter damage
- **Chloranthy Ring**: Stamina regeneration
- **Ring of Favor**: HP/Stamina/Equip load
- **Prisoner's Chain**: Stats without investment

## Historical Context

The Estoc has a controversial history in Souls PvP:
- Dark Souls 1: Already strong
- Dark Souls 2: Ice Rapier meta
- Dark Souls 3: "Bestoc" early patches
- Multiple nerfs but still viable

## Tips for Estoc Mastery

1. **Patience is Key**: Don't rush
2. **Space Control**: Use your range
3. **Stamina Management**: Always keep reserve
4. **Mix Defensive/Offensive**: Switch between shield and two-hand
5. **Ignore the Hate**: Play to win

## Common Complaints

"Estoc is cheap because..."
- Too much range ✓
- Shield poking ✓
- Boring to fight ✓
- No skill required ✗

While the Estoc has a low skill floor, mastering spacing and timing separates good players from R1 spammers.

The Estoc remains one of the most effective weapons in Dark Souls III, particularly for players who prefer a methodical, defensive approach to combat.
