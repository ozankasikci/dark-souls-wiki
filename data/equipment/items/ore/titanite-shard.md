# Titanite Shard

The **Titanite Shard** is the most basic and essential upgrade material in Dark Souls, used to reinforce weapons from +1 to +5 along the standard upgrade path.

## Description

Titanite shard for weapon reinforcement. Commonest of the titanites. Reinforces weapons to +5.

Titanite Shards form the foundation of weapon upgrading in Dark Souls. Every weapon that follows the standard reinforcement path requires these shards for its initial upgrades, making them one of the most frequently used items in the game.

## Strategic Importance

### Early Game Priority
- **First Upgrades**: Essential for weapon improvement
- **Damage Scaling**: Each upgrade significantly increases damage
- **Investment Value**: High return on early game souls
- **Progression Gate**: Required for effective combat

### Usage Planning
- **Weapon Selection**: Choose main weapon early
- **Resource Management**: Don't spread upgrades too thin
- **Backup Weapons**: Keep spare shards for weapon switching
- **Path Planning**: Ensure weapon can reach +5 before investing

## Upgrade Economics

### Cost Analysis
- **Purchase Cost**: 800 souls per shard
- **Farming Time**: 5-10 minutes per shard (farming)
- **Total Investment**: 7,200 souls to buy 9 shards for +5
- **Value Proposition**: Usually cheaper to farm early game

### Investment Strategy
- **Early Farming**: Farm shards rather than buy
- **Mid-Game Purchase**: Buy when souls are plentiful
- **Efficiency**: Farm when grinding other materials
- **Bulk Acquisition**: Stock up when farming efficiently

## Weapon Upgrade Path

### Standard Path Progression

2. **+5 → +10**: Large Titanite Shards (9 total)  
3. **+10 → +15**: Titanite Chunks (7 total)

## Farming Optimization

### Balder Knight Method
1. **Start**: Undead Parish bonfire
2. **Route**: Clear 3 Balder Knights near church
3. **Efficiency**: 2-3 minutes per run
4. **Expected**: 1 shard every 3-4 runs
5. **Bonus**: Rare Balder weapons may drop

### Item Discovery Enhancement
- **Covetous Gold Serpent Ring**: +200 item discovery
- **Humanity**: Up to +410 discovery at 10+ humanity

## Multi-Weapon Strategy

### Resource Allocation

- **Experimentation**: Keep some shards for testing

### Weapon Categories
- **Melee Primary**: Main combat weapon

- **Magic Focus**: Catalyst for spellcasters
- **Utility**: Shield, special weapons

## Common Mistakes

### Under-Investment  
- **Hoarding**: Keeping shards without using them
- **Late Upgrade**: Waiting too long to improve weapons
- **Inefficient Farming**: Not optimizing drop rates

## Advanced Tips

### Efficiency Optimization
- **Route Planning**: Combine farming with other objectives

- **Resource Bundling**: Farm multiple materials simultaneously
- **Progression Sync**: Align farming with natural progression

### Build Planning
