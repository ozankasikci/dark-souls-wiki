# Wooden Arrow

The **Wooden Arrow** is the most basic and widely available ammunition type in Dark Souls, serving as the standard projectile for most bow weapons.

## Description

Simple wooden arrow. Standard ammunition for most bows.

Wooden Arrows are the entry-level ammunition that most players will use when first experimenting with ranged combat. While not the most powerful option available, their low cost and wide availability make them perfect for general use.

## Statistics

- **Base Damage**: 50 physical damage
- **Weight**: 0.1 per arrow
- **Max Stack**: 999 arrows
- **Purchase Cost**: 5 souls each
- **Damage Type**: Physical (no special effects)

## Compatibility

Works with all standard bows:
- **Short Bow**: Basic starting bow
- **Longbow**: Improved range and damage
- **Black Bow of Pharis**: Longest range bow
- **Composite Bow**: Scaling bow option

## Acquisition

### Merchants
- **Undead Merchant** (Undead Burg): 5 souls each, unlimited
- **Crestfallen Merchant** (Sen's Fortress): 5 souls each, unlimited
- **Giant Blacksmith** (Anor Londo): 5 souls each, unlimited

### Starting Equipment
- **Hunter Class**: Starts with 30 wooden arrows
- **Some builds**: May include arrows in starting equipment

### Farming
- **Hollow Soldiers** (Undead Burg): Rare drop from archer enemies
- **Undead Archers** (Various locations): Uncommon drop
- **Not recommended**: Much cheaper to buy than farm

## Usage Strategy

### Early Game
- **Primary Ranged Option**: Reliable damage for new players
- **Enemy Pulling**: Draw individual enemies from groups
- **Weak Point Targeting**: Hit enemy weak spots safely
- **Backup Weapon**: When melee weapons break or are ineffective

### Mid-Late Game
- **Training Ammunition**: Practice aim without wasting expensive arrows
- **Weak Enemy Cleanup**: Finish off low-health enemies
- **Conservation**: Save special arrows for tough encounters
- **Bulk Shooting**: Large quantities for extended ranged combat

## Comparison with Other Arrows

| Arrow Type | Damage | Special Effect | Cost | Availability |
|------------|--------|----------------|------|--------------|
| Wooden Arrow | 50 | None | 5 souls | Unlimited |
| Large Arrow | 70 | None | 10 souls | Unlimited |
| Fire Arrow | 50 + Fire | Fire damage | 50 souls | Limited |
| Poison Arrow | 50 + Poison | Poison buildup | 100 souls | Limited |

## Tactical Applications

### PvE Combat
- **Archer Enemies**: Outrange enemy archers
- **Flying Enemies**: Hit gargoyles and other airborne foes
- **Environmental**: Trigger switches or break objects
- **Stealth**: Silent ranged attacks

### Boss Encounters
- **Supplemental Damage**: Chip damage during safe phases
- **Weak Point Abuse**: Target specific boss weak points
- **Kiting Strategy**: Maintain distance while dealing damage
- **Last Resort**: Backup when other strategies fail

## Economic Considerations

### Cost Efficiency
- **Cheap Investment**: 5 souls per arrow is very affordable
- **Bulk Purchase**: Buy 100-200 for general use
- **Soul Efficiency**: Much cheaper than repair costs on broken weapons

### Inventory Management
- **Weight Impact**: 100 arrows = 10 weight units
- **Stack Management**: Keep reasonable quantities (50-100)
- **Upgrade Path**: Transition to better arrows as resources allow

## Synergies

### Equipment
- **Hawk Ring**: Increases bow range significantly
- **Red Tearstone Ring**: Boost damage when health is low
- **Leo Ring**: Doesn't apply to arrows (thrust weapons only)

### Playstyles
- **Archer Build**: DEX-focused character with bow specialization
- **Hybrid Fighter**: Melee/ranged combination
- **Support Character**: Co-op player providing ranged assistance

## Notes

- **Damage Scaling**: Arrows don't scale with bow upgrades
- **Headshot Bonus**: Some enemies take extra damage from head hits
- **Retrieval**: Cannot retrieve fired arrows
- **No Durability**: Arrows are consumed on use
- **Unlimited Purchase**: Never need to worry about running out
- **Basic Requirement**: Essential for any bow-using character
- **Training Tool**: Perfect for learning bow mechanics
