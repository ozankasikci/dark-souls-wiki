## Lore Significance

The Basement Key represents the beginning of the Chosen Undead's descent into the depths of Lordran. Opening this door symbolically represents leaving the relative safety of the upper areas and venturing into the more dangerous, corruption-filled lower regions.

The key's placement after ringing the bell suggests that the bell's toll has somehow unlocked or activated this passage, connecting the church's holy mission with the darker journey ahead.
