4. **Systematic Search**: Check every cage in the fortress

### Timing Considerations

## Lore Context

The Cage Key represents the cruel imprisonment practices of Sen's Fortress. The fortress serves as a trial ground for potential successors to Gwyn, and the cages likely held those who failed the tests or were deemed unworthy.

Big Hat Logan's imprisonment suggests that even powerful sorcerers were not immune to the fortress's trials, while the placement of valuable items in cages indicates a systematic approach to testing worthiness through puzzle-solving and exploration.

## Optimization Tips

- **Documentation**: Remember cage locations for future runs

### Build Synergy

- **Completionist**: Required for 100% exploration
