## Lore Significance

Humanity represents the Dark Soul - the fourth Lord Soul discovered in the First Flame. Unlike the other Lord Souls claimed by gods, the Dark Soul was found by the Furtive Pygmy and shared among all humans.

This connection explains humanity's power to reverse the curse of undeath, as it restores the bearer's connection to their original human nature. The dark sprites are fragments of this primordial power, making them incredibly precious in the fading world of Lordran.

- **Recovery**: Can recover lost humanity from bloodstain
- **Visual Effect**: Character appearance improves with higher humanity
- **Hidden Benefits**: Affects chaos weapon scaling and curse resistance
