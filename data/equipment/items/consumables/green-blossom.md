# Green Blossom

The **Green Blossom** is a useful consumable herb that temporarily increases stamina regeneration, making it valuable for combat encounters and exploration where stamina management is crucial.

## Description

Medicinal herb. Temporarily boosts stamina regeneration.

Green Blossoms provide a temporary but significant boost to stamina regeneration speed for 60 seconds. This enhancement can be the difference between victory and defeat in prolonged combat encounters.

## Effects

- **Duration**: 60 seconds
- **Stacks**: Does not stack with Grass Crest Shield or Chloranthy Ring effects
- **Combat Utility**: Allows for more aggressive playstyles

- **Stack Planning**: Don't use with Grass Crest Shield or Chloranthy Ring
- **Emergency Situations**: Quick stamina boost when surrounded
- **Speedrunning**: Maintain high mobility during critical sections
