# Estus Flask

The **Estus Flask** is the primary healing item in Dark Souls, essential for survival throughout your journey. This sacred flask can be refilled at any bonfire and is the lifeline that keeps undead adventurers going in the harsh world of Lordran.

## Description

The undead treasure these dull green flasks. Fill with estus at bonfire. Fills HP.

The Estus Flask is automatically given to the player at the beginning of the game and serves as the primary method of healing. Unlike other consumable healing items, the Estus Flask is refilled every time you rest at a bonfire, making it a renewable source of health restoration.

## Usage

- **Primary Healing**: Restores a significant portion of your HP
- **Renewable**: Refills automatically when resting at bonfires
- **Upgradeable**: Can be reinforced with Fire Keeper Souls to increase healing amount
- **Expandable**: Additional uses can be gained by offering Humanity to bonfires

## Upgrade Path

The Estus Flask can be upgraded by giving **Fire Keeper Souls** to Fire Keepers:

- **Base**: Restores ~250 HP
- **+1**: Restores ~375 HP  
- **+2**: Restores ~500 HP
- **+3**: Restores ~625 HP
- **+4**: Restores ~750 HP
- **+5**: Restores ~875 HP
- **+6**: Restores ~1000 HP
- **+7**: Restores ~1125 HP (maximum)

## Increasing Uses

You start with 5 uses of the Estus Flask, but this can be increased:

- **Kindling Bonfires**: Offer Humanity at bonfires to increase Estus uses
- **Base Kindling**: 5 uses
- **Kindled Once**: 10 uses  
- **Kindled Twice**: 15 uses
- **Kindled Thrice**: 20 uses (requires Rite of Kindling)

## Strategy

- **Conservation**: Use Estus Flask wisely, especially in areas far from bonfires
- **Timing**: Drinking Estus has a long animation - find safe moments to heal
- **Backup Healing**: Carry additional healing items like Humanity or Divine Blessings for emergencies
- **Kindle Early**: Kindle bonfires you'll return to frequently for more Estus uses

## Lore

The Estus Flask is intrinsically tied to the bonfires and the Fire Keepers who tend them. The orange liquid within is connected to the First Flame itself, explaining why it can only be replenished at bonfires where the flame burns.

Fire Keepers possess souls that can enhance the flask's potency, making their sacrifice a meaningful way to strengthen this essential tool of survival.

## Notes

- The Estus Flask cannot be dropped, sold, or lost
- It's the most reliable healing method throughout the game
- Higher level Fire Keeper Souls provide the same upgrade benefit
- The flask's appearance and glow indicate how much healing it will provide
