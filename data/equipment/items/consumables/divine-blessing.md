# Divine Blessing

The **Divine Blessing** is one of the most powerful healing items in Dark Souls, providing complete restoration of health and curing all negative status effects. This rare and precious holy water is blessed by the gods themselves.

## Description

Holy water blessed by a goddess. Fully restores HP and cures all status ailments.

Divine Blessings are extremely rare consumables that provide instant, complete healing regardless of your maximum HP. They also cure poison, toxic, curse, and any other negative status effects, making them invaluable emergency items.

## Effects

- **Full HP Restoration**: Instantly restores all health points
- **Status Cure**: Removes poison, toxic, curse, bleeding, and other ailments
- **Instant Use**: No drinking animation like Estus Flask
- **Emergency Healing**: Perfect for dire situations

## Locations

Divine Blessings are rare and found in limited quantities:

### Fixed Locations
- **Undead Parish**: 1x in the church rafters
- **Anor Londo**: 2x in the cathedral
- **Duke's Archives**: 1x in the crystal cave area
- **New Londo Ruins**: 1x near the Four Kings fog gate
- **Painted World**: 1x hidden in the underground area

### Merchants

- **Patches**: May sell 1x after certain conditions

### Drops
- **Paladin Leeroy** (invasion): Guaranteed drop
- **Channelers**: Very rare drop (0.5% chance)

## Strategy

### When to Use
- **Boss Fights**: Save for challenging encounters where death is costly
- **Curse Emergency**: Immediate cure for curse without finding an NPC
- **Low Estus**: When far from bonfires with no Estus remaining
- **Status Overload**: Multiple negative effects active simultaneously

### Conservation Tips
- **Save for Late Game**: Early game healing can be managed with Estus
- **Boss Preparation**: Keep 1-2 for difficult boss encounters
- **Curse Insurance**: Always keep one for curse situations
- **PvP**: Excellent for online play emergencies

## Comparison to Other Healing

| Item | HP Restored | Status Cure | Availability | Speed |
|------|-------------|-------------|--------------|-------|
| Divine Blessing | 100% | All | Very Limited | Instant |
| Estus Flask | Variable | None | Renewable | Slow |
| Humanity | 100% | Curse Only | Limited | Medium |
| Green Blossom | None | Poison Only | Farmable | Fast |

## Lore

Divine Blessings represent the direct intervention of the gods in mortal affairs. The holy water is said to be blessed by Gwynevere, Princess of Sunlight, explaining its miraculous healing properties.

The rarity of these items reflects the gods' distance from the mortal world, especially as the Age of Fire wanes. Each blessing is a precious gift that connects the user momentarily to divine power.

## Notes

- **Limited Supply**: Only about 10-15 available per playthrough
- **No Farming**: Cannot be infinitely obtained (except very rare drops)
- **Weight**: Light enough to carry multiple without burden
- **Value**: Worth 1000 souls if sold (not recommended)
- **Animation**: No drinking animation makes it perfect for combat use
- **PvP Advantage**: Instant full heal can turn the tide of battles
