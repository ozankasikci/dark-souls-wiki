# Lordvessel

The **Lordvessel** is the most important progression item in Dark Souls, enabling fast travel between bonfires and serving as the container for the Lord Souls required to access the final area of the game.

## Description

Chalice of the primordial lords. Can warp between bonfires and contains the Lord Souls needed to access the Kiln of the First Flame.

The Lordvessel is a sacred chalice created to hold the power of the Lord Souls. Once obtained, it fundamentally changes how you navigate the world and marks the beginning of the endgame sequence.

## Acquisition

- **Source**: Gwynevere, Princess of Sunlight (Anor Londo)
- **Prerequisites**: Defeat Ornstein & Smough
- **Automatic**: Given during story progression
- **Required**: Cannot progress to endgame without it

## Primary Functions

### Fast Travel
- **Bonfire Warping**: Instantly travel between discovered bonfires
- **Selective Access**: Only certain bonfires are warp-enabled
- **Game Changer**: Dramatically improves navigation efficiency
- **Quality of Life**: Eliminates long backtracking sequences

### Lord Soul Container
- **Soul Storage**: Holds the four Lord Souls needed for endgame
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual indicator of endgame completion
- **Gate Keeper**: Required to access Kiln of the First Flame
- **Story Progression**: Central to the main quest narrative

## Warp-Enabled Bonfires

### Major Hub Locations
- **Firelink Shrine**: Central hub bonfire
- **Anor Londo**: Princess chamber bonfire
- **Duke's Archives**: Entrance and prison bonfires
- **Tomb of Giants**: Multiple warp points

### Area Access Points
- **Depths**: Bonfire near entrance
- **Demon Ruins**: Several key bonfires
- **Lost Izalith**: Daughter of Chaos bonfire
- **New Londo Ruins**: Various strategic locations

## Required Lord Souls

### The Four Lord Souls
1. **Bequeathed Lord Soul Shard** (The Four Kings)
2. **Lord Soul** (Gravelord Nito)
3. **Lord Soul Shard** (The Witch of Izalith/Bed of Chaos)
4. **Bequeathed Lord Soul Shard** (Seath the Scaleless)

### Collection Strategy
- **Any Order**: Lord Souls can be obtained in any sequence
- **Difficulty Varies**: Some areas more challenging than others
- **Preparation**: Each area requires different strategies
- **Completion**: All four required before final area access

## Strategic Impact

### Exploration Efficiency

- **Build Completion**: Finalize character development

## Placement Decision

### Two Serpent Options
- **Frampt (Orthodox)**: Place Lordvessel with Kingseeker Frampt
- **Kaathe (Alternative)**: Place with Darkstalker Kaathe
- **Different Paths**: Choice affects certain covenant access
- **Story Impact**: Influences ending narrative perspective

### Consequences
- **Frampt Path**: Traditional "Link the Fire" route
- **Kaathe Path**: Access to Darkwraith covenant and alternative ending
- **Permanent**: Decision cannot be reversed
- **Minor Impact**: Doesn't significantly affect gameplay mechanics

## Fast Travel Strategy

### Efficient Navigation
- **Hub System**: Use Firelink Shrine as central hub

## Lore Significance

### Creation and Purpose
The Lordvessel was created to contain and harness the power of the Lord Souls, the remnants of the souls found in the First Flame. It represents the unity of the great lords' power.

### Chosen Undead Role
Receiving the Lordvessel marks the player as the chosen successor to gather the Lord Souls and decide the fate of the First Flame, either linking it or letting it fade.

### Serpent Agendas
The two primordial serpents represent different philosophies about the Age of Fire and humanity's role, with the Lordvessel placement reflecting the player's alignment.
