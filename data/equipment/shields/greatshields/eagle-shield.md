## Special Properties
- Lightest greatshield in the game
- Second best resistance to Curse build-up among greatshields
- Cannot parry (shield bash instead)

## Location
- **Blighttown**: Found on a rafter near the upper area bonfire
- From the upper bonfire, head toward the swamp, past the Fire Dogs. Take the ladders down and follow the path hugging the stone pillar. The shield is on a corpse at the end of a stone beam.

## Notes
- Best greatshield for low-strength builds due to lowest requirements
- At +15, has 84 stability - enough to tank Manus and Artorias
- Pre-patch 1.06 had 100% physical block, now 95%
- Excellent curse resistance makes it useful in Great Hollow
