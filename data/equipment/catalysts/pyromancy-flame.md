# Pyromancy Flame

The **Pyromancy Flame** is the essential catalyst for casting pyromancy spells in Dark Souls Remastered.

## Overview

Unlike sorcery and miracles, pyromancy requires no stat investment to use effectively. The power of pyromancies scales only with the upgrade level of your Pyromancy Flame, making it accessible to any build.

## Acquisition

- **Starting Equipment**: Pyromancer class begins with this item
- **Laurentius of the Great Swamp**: Rescue him from the Depths to obtain if you didn't start as Pyromancer

## Upgrade System

The Pyromancy Flame has a unique upgrade path:

### Standard Path (+0 to +15)
- Upgraded by pyromancy trainers using souls
- No titanite required
- Cost increases with each level

### Ascended Path (+0 to +5)
- After reaching +15, can be ascended by Quelana of Izalith
- Significantly more expensive but much more powerful
- Maximum magic adjustment: 230

## Pyromancy Trainers

1. **Laurentius of the Great Swamp**: Upgrades to +15
2. **Quelana of Izalith**: Ascends and upgrades ascended flame
3. **Eingyi**: Can upgrade if you have the Old Witch's Ring

## Compatible Spells

### Offensive
- Fireball / Great Fireball
- Fire Orb / Great Chaos Fireball
- Combustion / Great Combustion
- Fire Tempest / Chaos Storm
- Fire Whip

### Utility
- Power Within
- Iron Flesh
- Flash Sweat

## Usage Tips

1. **No Stat Requirements**: Perfect for any build as backup damage
2. **Upgrade Priority**: Upgrading your flame is the only way to increase pyromancy damage
3. **PvP**: Great Combustion is one of the fastest spells in the game

## Notes

- Weighs 0.0 units, making it free to carry
- Casting speed is affected by Dexterity (45 DEX = max cast speed)
- Cannot be dropped or traded
- Having a +10 or higher flame makes Quelana appear in Blighttown
