## Lore
Fire Keepers are bound to the flame they tend, their souls slowly consumed by the very fire they nurture. These souls contain immense power, having absorbed the essence of countless flames over the ages. The Fire Keeper Soul represents both duty and sacrifice, embodying the eternal vigil of those who tend the bonfires.
