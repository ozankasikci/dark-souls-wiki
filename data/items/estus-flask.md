# Estus Flask

## Description
The Undead treasure these dull green flasks. Fill with Estus at bonfires, and drink to restore HP. The Estus Flasks are linked to the bonfires, and the Undead ones become imbued with the bonfires' heat.

## Stats
- **Initial Uses**: 5 (can be increased)
- **HP Restored**: ~300 at base, increases with upgrades
- **Max Uses**: 20 (with all Kindling)

## How It Works

### Refilling
- Rest at any bonfire to fully refill your Estus Flask
- Number of charges depends on bonfire kindling level

### Kindling Bonfires
Bonfires can be kindled using Humanity:
- **Unlit**: 5 Estus charges
- **Kindled (1 Humanity)**: 10 Estus charges
- **Kindled x2 (Rite of Kindling required)**: 15 Estus charges
- **Kindled x3 (Rite of Kindling required)**: 20 Estus charges

### Rite of Kindling
- Obtained after defeating Pinwheel in the Catacombs
- Allows kindling beyond the first level

## Upgrading Estus Potency

Give **Fire Keeper Souls** to any Fire Keeper to increase HP restored:
- Base: 300 HP
- +1: 400 HP, +2: 500 HP, +3: 600 HP
- +4: 650 HP, +5: 700 HP, +6: 750 HP
- +7: 800 HP (maximum)

### Fire Keeper Soul Locations
1. Undead Parish - Church near the Channeler
2. Blighttown - On the rotating bridge platform
3. New Londo Ruins - Behind illusory wall
4. Duke's Archives - In a chest
5. Quelaag's Domain - From the Fair Lady (not recommended to kill)
6. Anor Londo - Darkmoon Knightess (not recommended to kill)

## Tips
- Always kindle important bonfires (boss areas, frequently visited spots)
- Firelink Shrine starts pre-kindled to 10 charges
- Killing enemies sometimes grants bonus Estus charges in multiplayer

## Notes
- Cannot be dropped or traded
- The flask never runs out, only needs refilling
- The green glow represents the bonfire's healing power
