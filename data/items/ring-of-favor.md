# Ring of Favor

## Description
A ring symbolizing the favor of the goddess Fina. Increases HP, stamina, and maximum equip load.

Fina's favor knows no boundaries, but the ring breaks when removed.

## Effects
- **HP**: +20%
- **Stamina**: +20%
- **Equip Load**: +20%

## Acquisition
- Dropped by Lautrec of Carim
- Can be obtained early by killing him in Firelink Shrine
- Obtained naturally through his questline

## Tips
- One of the best rings in the game
- Breaks permanently if removed - plan carefully
- Excellent for all builds
- Stacks with other percentage-based bonuses
- Cannot be repaired if broken

## Lore
This ring was granted to those who served the goddess Fina with unwavering devotion. Lautrec's possession of this ring hints at his past service to the goddess, though his methods of showing devotion are questionable at best. The ring's fragile nature reflects Fina's fickle favor - once lost, it cannot be regained.
