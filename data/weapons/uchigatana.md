# Uchigatana

The Uchigatana is a swift katana that combines respectable damage with innate bleed buildup. Its unique moveset and weapon art make it a favorite among dexterity builds and PvP enthusiasts.

## Weapon Characteristics

The Uchigatana stands out among katanas for several reasons:

### Weapon Art: Hold
The Hold stance enables two special attacks:

- **R2 (Hiltless Thrust)**: Long-range thrust that damages the user

## Build Recommendations
