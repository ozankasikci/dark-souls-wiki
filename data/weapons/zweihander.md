# Zweihander

The Zweihander is a massive ultra greatsword that trades speed for incredible reach and damage. A favorite among strength builds, this weapon can devastate opponents with its wide swings and high poise damage.

## Weapon Overview

Despite being classified as an Ultra Greatsword, the Zweihander is unique for several reasons:
- Lowest stat requirements in its class
- Unique horizontal R2 attacks
- Exceptional reach
- Lower weight compared to other ultra greatswords

## Moveset Analysis

### One-Handed
- **R1**: Wide horizontal swings
- **R2**: Unique horizontal sweep (different from other UGS)
- **Rolling R1**: Upward slash
- **Running R1**: Powerful overhead slam

### Two-Handed
- **R1**: Vertical slams with hyper armor
- **R2**: Wide horizontal sweep
- **Weapon Art (Stomp)**: Grants poise and leads into devastating uppercut

## Build Optimization

### Pure Strength (66 STR)
The Zweihander reaches its maximum potential at 66 strength when two-handed (effective 99 STR). Heavy infusion is recommended for pure physical damage.

### Quality Build (40/40)
While not optimal, quality builds can still make effective use of the Zweihander with refined infusion.

### Elemental Builds
- **Chaos/Dark**: Excellent for pyromancer builds
- **Lightning**: Viable for faith builds, though the scaling is modest

## PvP Strategy

The Zweihander excels in PvP due to:
1. **Space Control**: Its massive reach keeps opponents at bay
2. **Hyper Armor**: Trades favorably with smaller weapons
3. **Roll Catching**: The wide swings catch panic rolls
4. **Stamina Pressure**: Forces opponents to manage stamina carefully

### Common Combos
- R1 → R1 (true combo on hit)
- Stomp → R2 (can catch aggressive players)
- Running R1 → R1 (rollcatch setup)

## Comparison with Other Ultra Greatswords

| Weapon | Weight | STR Req | Reach | Unique Features |
|--------|--------|---------|-------|-----------------|
| Zweihander | 10.0 | 19 | Exceptional | Horizontal R2s, low requirements |
| Greatsword | 20.0 | 28 | Very Good | Higher damage, standard UGS moveset |
| Fume UGS | 25.5 | 50 | Good | S-scaling in STR, strike damage |
| Cathedral Knight GS | 15.0 | 26 | Good | Strike damage on 2H R2s |

## Tips for New Players

1. **Spacing is Key**: Use the Zweihander's reach to hit enemies outside their range
2. **Don't Spam**: Each swing consumes significant stamina
3. **Learn to Aim**: The wide swings can miss if not properly positioned
4. **Use Hyper Armor**: Trade hits with confidence during your attack animations
5. **Mix Up Attacks**: Alternate between R1s and R2s to keep opponents guessing
