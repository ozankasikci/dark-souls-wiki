# Siegmeyer of Catarina

*"Hmmm... Mmm... Mm! Oh!"*

Siegmeyer of Catarina, affectionately known as the "Onion Knight" due to his distinctive armor, is one of the most memorable characters in Dark Souls. His adventurous spirit and thoughtful nature hide a tragic story of pride and determination.

## Character Overview

Siegmeyer is a knight from Catarina embarking on an adventure through Lordran. Despite his jovial and easy-going demeanor, he faces increasingly difficult challenges that test his resolve. His questline is one of the most emotionally impactful in the game, dealing with themes of pride, purpose, and the burden of being saved.

## Locations & Questline

### 1. Sen's Fortress - First Encounter
Found sitting outside the fortress gate before it opens. He'll be pondering how to enter. After ringing both bells and opening Sen's Fortress, he'll move inside.

### 2. Sen's Fortress - Boulder Trap
Located in the tower with the boulder trap mechanism. He's stuck behind the boulders. Change the boulder path to free him.

### 3. Anor Londo - Silver Knight Room
Found in a room with three Silver Knights near the bonfire. You must kill all Silver Knights in the room before talking to him, or he'll help fight them.

### 4. Firelink Shrine
After Anor Londo, he appears at Firelink Shrine if you've been following his quest properly.

### 5. Blighttown - Poison Swamp
Found in the poison swamp near the entrance to The Great Hollow. Give him 3 Purple Moss Clumps to continue his quest.

### 6. Lost Izalith - Chaos Eater Pit
The critical encounter. Found overlooking a pit of Chaos Eaters. Your actions here determine the quest outcome.

### 7. Ash Lake - Final Encounter
If his questline is completed with him surviving with >50% HP in Lost Izalith, the final scene occurs here with his daughter, Sieglinde.

## Quest Outcomes

### Best Ending - Ash Lake
1. At Lost Izalith, speak to him then jump down
2. Help kill the Chaos Eaters but ensure he survives with >50% HP
3. Talk to him after the battle
4. Find him and Sieglinde at Ash Lake for the conclusion

### Alternate Ending - Lost Izalith Death
If Siegmeyer's HP falls below 50% during the Chaos Eater fight, he'll give you the Speckled Stoneplate Ring and die, ending his quest there.

### Bad Ending - Hollow
If you kill all Chaos Eaters before talking to him, he'll become depressed and eventually go hollow, forcing you to fight him later.

## Dialogue Highlights

### Sen's Fortress
*"Hmmm... Mmm... Mm! Oh! Pardon me, I was absorbed in thought. I am Siegmeyer of Catarina. Quite honestly, I have run flat up against a wall. Or a gate, I should say. The thing just won't budge. No matter how long I wait."*

### Anor Londo
*"Well! Fancy meeting you here. I am saved. I thought I might never escape that awful fortress. You know, I was thinking about leaving for a little adventure. That's why I came here, but I'm afraid I'm a bit thick, and I accidentally got myself stuck."*

### Lost Izalith
*"I've made it this far, but I'm short on antidotes and find myself in quite a fix. Perhaps we'll have another development? Mm, no, that's no good. It'll be days before I'm out of here. Blast!"*

### Final Words (if saved)
*"Ahh, finally, I'm free. Now I can get back to work... Hmm... Actually, I think I'll have a rest. I'm exhausted from all that... adventuring. You go along, and I'll catch up. I'll be fine. I just need a rest..."*
