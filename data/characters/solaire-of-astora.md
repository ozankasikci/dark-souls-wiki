# Solaire of Astora

*"If only I could be so grossly incandescent!"*

Solaire of Astora is a Warrior of Sunlight who has become the most beloved character in Dark Souls history. His jolly demeanor and helpful nature stand in stark contrast to the grim world of Lordran.

## Character Overview

Solaire is an exceptionally skilled warrior who deliberately became Undead to journey to Lordran in search of a sun of his own. He does not rely on any special powers beyond his signature miracles and rigorous training, as his equipment exhibits no special traits. His armor and shield are decorated with a hand-painted sun, reflecting his worship of the Sun, and by association, Lord Gwyn.

## Locations

### First Encounter - Undead Burg
Solaire is first found just after defeating the Taurus Demon, on a platform to the right before crossing the bridge with the Hellkite Dragon. He gazes at the sun and will give you the **White Sign Soapstone** when spoken to.

### Anor Londo
After ringing both Bells of Awakening, Solaire can be found at a bonfire in Anor Londo, near the Silver Knight archer area.

### Sunlight Altar
After defeating Ornstein and Smough, Solaire moves to the Sunlight Altar in Undead Parish, where you can join the Warrior of Sunlight covenant.

### Demon Ruins/Lost Izalith
The final part of his questline takes place after defeating the Centipede Demon, where his fate depends on your actions.

## Questline

### Summon Locations
Solaire can be summoned for the following boss fights:
- **Bell Gargoyles** - Near the fog gate
- **Gaping Dragon** - In the Depths, near the boss area
- **Ornstein and Smough** - On the stairs before the fog gate
- **Centipede Demon** - Before the fog gate
- **Gwyn, Lord of Cinder** - At the top of the stairs (only if saved)

### Saving Solaire

To save Solaire and complete his questline with the good ending:

1. **Method 1 - Chaos Servant Shortcut**
   - Join the Chaos Servant covenant and reach rank +2 (30 Humanity)
   - Open the shortcut to Lost Izalith from Demon Ruins
   - Kill the red-eyed Chaos Bug that drops the Sunlight Maggot
   - Then speak to Solaire after Centipede Demon

2. **Method 2 - Poison/Toxic Mist**
   - Use Poison Mist, Toxic Mist, or Dark Fog through the shortcut door
   - Kill the Chaos Bug without opening the shortcut
   - The two-handed strong attack of the Dragon Greatsword also works

3. **Method 3 - Hostile Delay**
   - After killing Centipede Demon, attack Solaire to make him hostile (don't kill)
   - Progress through Lost Izalith and kill the Chaos Bug
   - Request absolution from Oswald of Carim

If you fail to save him, Solaire will be found in Lost Izalith wearing the Sunlight Maggot, driven insane and hostile.

## Dialogue

### First Meeting
*"Oh, hello there. I will stay behind, to gaze at the sun. The sun is a wondrous body. Like a magnificent father! If only I could be so grossly incandescent!"*

### Offering Cooperation
*"I am Solaire of Astora, an adherent of the Lord of Sunlight. Now that I am Undead, I have come to this great land, the birthplace of Lord Gwyn, to seek my very own sun!"*

### On Jolly Cooperation
*"The way I see it, our fates appear to be intertwined. In a land brimming with Hollows, could that really be mere chance? So, what do you say? Why not help one another on this lonely journey?"*

### If Saved in Lost Izalith
*"I cannot find my own sun... I have failed... My sun... it's setting... It's dark... so dark..."*

## Combat Information

When summoned as a phantom:
- Uses Lightning Spear miracles
- Wields Sunlight Straight Sword and Sunlight Shield
- Has high health and defense
- Very aggressive against bosses
- Can heal himself with Estus Flask

## Lore Implications

Solaire's quest for his "own sun" has sparked numerous theories:
- Some believe he is the firstborn son of Gwyn, stripped of his deific status
- Others see him as a reflection of the player's journey
- His potential linking of the Fire in his own world suggests parallel timelines
- The Sunlight Maggot he seeks may represent false hope or delusion

## Tips

- Always exhaust his dialogue at each location
- Summoning him for bosses doesn't affect his questline
- He sells the "Praise the Sun" gesture for free
- His sign won't appear if you're in the Darkwraith covenant
- Killing him yields 1000 souls and all his equipment, but ends his questline

## Trivia

- His "Praise the Sun" gesture has become iconic in gaming culture
- In development, he was originally going to be the tutorial character
- His armor set is one of the most popular for Fashion Souls
- The Sunlight Shield has the same design he painted himself
- His voice actor also voiced Vamos and the Giant Blacksmith
