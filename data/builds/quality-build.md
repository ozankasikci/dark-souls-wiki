# Quality Build

The **Quality Build** is one of the most versatile and popular builds in Dark Souls Remastered, offering excellent weapon variety and consistent damage output.

## Overview

This build focuses on leveling Strength and Dexterity equally (hence "quality"), allowing you to effectively use almost any physical weapon in the game. It's perfect for players who want to experiment with different playstyles without respeccing.

## Starting Class

**Warrior** is the optimal starting class for this build due to:
- Balanced starting stats
- Low Intelligence and Faith (minimizes wasted levels)
- Good starting equipment

## Stat Distribution (SL 120)

| Stat | Level | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| **Vitality** | 40 | Soft cap for HP |
| **Attunement** | 10 | Base level (no spells needed) |
| **Endurance** | 40 | Soft cap for stamina |
| **Strength** | 40 | Quality scaling threshold |
| **Dexterity** | 40 | Quality scaling threshold |
| **Resistance** | 10 | Never level this stat |
| **Intelligence** | 9 | Base level |
| **Faith** | 9 | Base level |

## Weapon Recommendations

### Primary Weapons
1. **Claymore** - The quintessential quality weapon
   - Excellent moveset with thrust attacks
   - C/C scaling at +15
   - Found on the bridge in Undead Burg

2. **Black Knight Sword** - High damage option
   - B/E scaling, benefits from quality stats
   - 20% bonus damage to demons
   - Random drop from Black Knights

3. **Murakumo** - Curved greatsword option
   - Massive range and damage
   - E/B scaling favors DEX slightly
   - Sold by Shiva of the East

### Backup Weapons
