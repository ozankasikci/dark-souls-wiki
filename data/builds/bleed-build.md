# Bleed Build

The **Bleed Build** specializes in rapid bleed buildup, dealing percentage-based damage that ignores defense and destroys high-HP targets.

## Overview

This build uses the fastest bleed weapons to quickly build up the bleed meter, triggering massive damage bursts. Bleed damage equals 30-50% of the target's maximum HP, making it devastating against tanky opponents.

## Starting Class

**Thief** is ideal:
- Starts with Bandit's Knife
- High DEX start
- Master Key gift

## Stat Distribution (SL 120)

| Stat | Level | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| **Vitality** | 45 | Good survivability |
| **Attunement** | 12 | 2 slots for utility |
| **Endurance** | 40 | Maximum stamina |
| **Strength** | 14 | Weapon requirements |
| **Dexterity** | 40 | Primary damage stat |
| **Resistance** | 10 | Base level |
| **Intelligence** | 8 | Base level |
| **Faith** | 14 | Bloodbite Ring alt |

## Bleed Weapons

### Top Tier
1. **Gold Tracer** - Fastest bleed
   - 30 bleed buildup per hit
   - Curved sword speed
   - DLC exclusive

2. **Lifehunt Scythe** - Highest bleed
   - 50 bleed buildup per hit (highest in game)
   - Self-bleed risk (40 buildup on yourself per hit!)
   - Deals 50% of target's max HP on proc
   - From Priscilla Soul

3. **Priscilla's Dagger** - Critical bleed
   - 20 bleed buildup per hit (lowest, but 50% HP damage on proc)
   - Best used as a finisher after building bleed with another weapon
   - Occult damage type

### Alternative Options
- **Bandit's Knife** - Starting weapon, 30 buildup, 147 critical modifier (highest for daggers!)
- **Painting Guardian Sword** - A scaling, 30 buildup
- **Katanas** (Uchigatana, Iaito, Chaos Blade) - Range option, 33-36 buildup

## Bleed Mechanics

> **How Bleed Works**: Each hit adds to a hidden bleed meter on the target. When the meter fills (based on target's Bleed Resistance), "Blood Loss" triggers dealing percentage HP damage. The meter decreases by 5 points per second when not being hit.

| Weapon | Bleed Buildup (per hit) | Damage on Proc |
|--------|-------------------------|----------------|
| Gold Tracer | 30 | 30% max HP |
| Lifehunt Scythe | 50 | 50% max HP |
| Priscilla's Dagger | 20 | 50% max HP |
| Bandit's Knife | 30 | 30% max HP |
| Uchigatana | 33 | 30% max HP |
| Painting Guardian Sword | 30 | 30% max HP |

**Note**: Dexterity does NOT affect bleed buildup in DS1 (unlike DS3's Luck stat). Bleed buildup is fixed per weapon.

## Armor Setup

### Light Armor
- **Chester's Set** - DLC fashion
  - High bleed resist
  - Good look

- **Shadow Set** - Ninja theme
  - Decent stats
  - Blighttown

### Bloodbite Options
- Mix armor for 300+ bleed resist
- Prevents self-bleed
- Essential for Lifehunt

## Ring Setup

### Offensive Build
1. **Dark Wood Grain Ring** - Mobility
2. **Ring of Favor and Protection** - Stats

### Defensive Build
1. **Bloodbite Ring** - Bleed resist
2. **Ring of Favor and Protection** - Stats

## Combat Strategy

### Bleed Management
1. Track bleed buildup mentally
2. Pressure before meter reset
3. Switch targets after proc
4. Use meter as timer

### PvE Strategy
1. Rush down enemies
2. Bleed procs trivialize bosses
3. Switch weapons for resistances
4. Keep pressure constant

### PvP Strategy
1. Aggressive rushdown
2. Punish passive play
3. Force panic rolls
4. Mix up timings

## Miracles

With 14 Faith:
- **Force** - Spacing tool
- **Heal** - Between fights
- **Homeward** - Quick escape

- ✓ Ignores defense
- ✓ Fast playstyle
- ✓ Psychological pressure

### Disadvantages
- ✗ Self-bleed risk
- ✗ Some immune enemies
- ✗ Requires aggression
- ✗ Close range needed

## Advanced Techniques

- Catch opponents off-guard

### Wake-up Pressure
- Time attacks on getup
- Force immediate choices
- Maintain momentum

## Boss Strategy

Bleed-weak bosses:
- **Stray Demon** - 3 procs
- **Smough** - High HP target
- **Manus** - If aggressive

Immune bosses:
- Most demons
- Skeletons
- Some dragons

## Build Variations

### Pure Bleed (99 DEX)
- Maximum attack speed
- More bleed procs
- Glass cannon

### Quality Bleed
- 27/40 STR/DEX
- Weapon variety
- More balanced

## Notes

- Bleed damage ignores shields and armor
- Bleed meter decreases at 5 points per second when not being hit
- Standard bleed deals 30% max HP, Priscilla weapons deal 50% max HP
- After a bleed proc, there's a 2-second immunity window
- Rolling at the exact moment of proc can negate the damage (but still shows the effect)
- DEX does NOT increase bleed buildup (this is a DS3 mechanic with Luck)
- Aggressive playstyle mandatory to prevent bleed meter reset
