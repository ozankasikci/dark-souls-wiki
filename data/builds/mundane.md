# Jack-of-All-Trades Build

> **Important Note**: This build was previously called "Mundane Build" but has been renamed for accuracy. The "Mundane" infusion is a **Dark Souls 2 mechanic only** that scales weapon damage based on your lowest stat. **This mechanic does not exist in Dark Souls 1 Remastered.** In DS1, leveling all stats equally provides no special scaling benefit - it simply makes you mediocre at everything. This build is purely for experimentation and challenge runs.

The **Jack-of-All-Trades Build** distributes stats equally across all attributes, creating a versatile but unoptimized character. This is an experimental/challenge build, not a meta choice.

## Overview

This experimental build distributes stats evenly across all attributes, creating a jack-of-all-trades character. **Unlike Dark Souls 2's Mundane infusion, DS1 provides no mechanical benefit to equal stat distribution.** While not excelling in any specific area, the build offers versatility and adaptability for players who want a unique challenge.

## Starting Class

**Deprived** is thematically perfect:
- Starts at SL 6 with all stats at 11
- Naked beginning represents blank slate
- Efficient stat distribution
- True to the balanced concept

## Stat Distribution (SL 120)

| Stat | Level | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| **Vitality** | 27 | Balanced HP pool |
| **Attunement** | 27 | 6 spell slots available |
| **Endurance** | 27 | Good stamina management |
| **Strength** | 27 | Can wield most weapons |
| **Dexterity** | 27 | Decent scaling and cast speed |
| **Resistance** | 27 | Unusual but balanced choice |
| **Intelligence** | 27 | Moderate sorcery power |
| **Faith** | 27 | Decent miracle effectiveness |
