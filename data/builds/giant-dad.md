# Giant Dad (The Legend)

**"Well, what is it?"** The most infamous build in Dark Souls history, Giant Dad combines maximum poise with fast roll and devastating Zweihander damage.

## Overview

Born from the "He's Back" meme video by OnlyAfro, Giant Dad became the most recognizable build in Dark Souls. Despite being a "meme build," it's surprisingly effective in both PvE and PvP due to its optimized stat distribution and equipment choices.

## The Legend Never Dies

This build achieves the "impossible" trinity:
- **Maximum Poise** (77 with Giant's Set)
- **Fast Roll** (<25% equip load)
- **High Damage** (Chaos Zweihander)

## Starting Class

**Bandit** is mandatory for optimal stat distribution:
- Lowest combined INT/FAI
- Decent starting END
- 14 base STR (only need 2 more)

## Stat Distribution (SL 99)

| Stat | Level | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| **Vitality** | 48 | Maximum HP within build constraints |
| **Attunement** | 10 | 1 spell slot for Black Flame |
| **Endurance** | 66 | THE LEGEND'S SECRET - Fast roll in Giant's |
| **Strength** | 16 | Minimum for 2H Zweihander |
| **Dexterity** | 10 | Don't tell anyone you leveled this |
| **Resistance** | 11 | Base (never level) |
| **Intelligence** | 8 | Base |
| **Faith** | 9 | Base |

## Equipment Setup

### The Legendary Loadout

1. **Chaos Zweihander +5**
   - The bass cannon
   - 2-handed for maximum destruction
   - Chaos infusion for stat-independent damage

2. **Grass Crest Shield**
   - Stamina regeneration
   - On your back 24/7
   - Never actually block with it

3. **Mask of the Father**
   - +5% max equip load
   - THE FATHER OF GIANTS
   - Essential for fast roll

4. **Giant Armor Set +5**
   - Maximum poise (chest/gauntlets/leggings)
   - Upgrade to +5 for defense
   - The legend's uniform

### Rings (DO NOT REMOVE)
