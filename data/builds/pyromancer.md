# Pyromancer Build

The **Pyromancer** build is one of the most devastating builds in Dark Souls, combining powerful fire spells with dexterity-based weapons for versatile combat.

## Overview

This build maximizes pyromancy damage while maintaining solid melee capabilities. Pyromancy doesn't scale with stats, making it perfect for hybrid builds. High dexterity increases casting speed significantly.

## Starting Class

**Pyromancer** is the obvious choice:
- Starts with Pyromancy Flame
- Optimal stat distribution
- Access to Fireball immediately

| **Vitality** | 30 | Sufficient HP for caster |
| **Attunement** | 23 | 6 spell slots |
| **Endurance** | 40 | Max stamina for dodging |
| **Strength** | 16 | Minimum for some weapons |
| **Dexterity** | 45 | Max cast speed at 45 DEX |
