# Dark Sorcerer

> **Note**: This build was previously called "Hexer" but has been renamed for accuracy. "Hexes" as a magic school do not exist in Dark Souls 1 - they were introduced in Dark Souls 2. Dark Souls 1 has "dark sorceries" which are a subset of regular Sorceries.

The **Dark Sorcerer** specializes in dark sorceries and forbidden Oolacile magic, using the power of the Abyss to corrupt and destroy enemies with devastating dark spells.

## Overview

This build focuses on dark sorceries introduced in the Artorias of the Abyss DLC, particularly those obtained from Manus. The Dark Sorcerer combines high intelligence with select dark spells to create a unique magical assassin playstyle. Note that dark sorceries in DS1 are classified under Sorceries, not as a separate magic school.

## Starting Class

**Sorcerer** provides the best foundation:
- Highest starting intelligence (15)
- Good attunement base
- Comes with Soul Arrow
- Catalyst included
