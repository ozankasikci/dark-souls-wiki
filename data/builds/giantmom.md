# GiantMom

**"The Mother of Giants"** - The nurturing counterpart to Giant Dad, combining unstoppable poise with maternal instincts and protective capabilities.

## Overview

GiantMom represents the caring, protective side of the Giant family builds. While maintaining the legendary poise and fast roll combination, this build adds healing capabilities and supportive elements for jolly cooperation.

## The Legend's Origin

Born from the same meme culture as Giant Dad, GiantMom emerged as the supportive parent figure who protects her children (other players) while still being able to devastate enemies with the bass cannon.

## Starting Class

**Bandit** maintains the legendary stat distribution:
- Optimal stat spread for the build

| **Endurance** | 66 | THE MOTHER'S STAMINA |
| **Strength** | 16 | Minimum for 2H Zweihander |
| **Dexterity** | 10 | Don't tell anyone you leveled this |
