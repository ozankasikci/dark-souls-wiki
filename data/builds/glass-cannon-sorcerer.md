# Glass Cannon Sorcerer

The ultimate magical powerhouse that turns bosses into jokes with devastating sorcery damage at the cost of survivability.

## Overview

This build maximizes INT and magic damage bonuses to achieve the highest possible sorcery damage in the game. With proper positioning and timing, you can one-shot many enemies and melt bosses in seconds. The trade-off? You'll die in 1-2 hits from almost anything.

## Philosophy

"The best defense is obliterating enemies before they can attack."

## Starting Class

**Sorcerer** is the only choice:
- Highest starting INT (15)
- Lowest faith for min-maxing
- Starts with Soul Arrow
- Optimal stat distribution

## Stat Distribution (SL 120)

| Stat | Level | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| **Vitality** | 30 | Bare minimum survivability |
| **Attunement** | 50 | 10 spell slots |
| **Endurance** | 20 | Light equipment = less needed |
| **Strength** | 16 | For Moonlight Greatsword |
| **Dexterity** | 11 | Base (faster casting starts at 35) |
| **Resistance** | 8 | Never level this |
| **Intelligence** | 50 | Maximum sorcery damage |
| **Faith** | 8 | Base level |
