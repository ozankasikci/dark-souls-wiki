# Havel Tank Build

The **Havel Tank** build embodies Havel the Rock himself - an unstoppable force in the heaviest armor, wielding devastating strength weapons.

## Overview

This build achieves the legendary "fast-rolling Havel" - wearing full Havel's armor while maintaining fast roll speed. It requires extreme endurance investment but creates an nearly invincible character.

## Starting Class

**Knight** is optimal:
- Good starting END
- Low wasted stats
- Decent equipment

## Stat Distribution (SL 120)

| Stat | Level | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| **Vitality** | 50 | Maximum HP |
| **Attunement** | 10 | Base level |
| **Endurance** | 66 | Fast roll requirement |
| **Strength** | 40 | Weapon requirements |
| **Dexterity** | 10 | Base level |
| **Resistance** | 11 | Base level |
| **Intelligence** | 9 | Base level |
| **Faith** | 11 | Base level |

## Equipment Loadout

### The Havel Experience
1. **Dragon Tooth** - Havel's hammer
   - D STR scaling
   - 40 STR requirement
   - Unique moveset

2. **Havel's Greatshield** - Best stability
   - 50 STR requirement
   - 84 stability
   - Special R2 buff

3. **Full Havel's Set** - Maximum defense
   - 50 total weight
   - 121 poise
   - Highest physical defense

## Weight Management

### Fast Roll Requirements
- Total Equipment Load: 133.3
- Havel's Set: 50.0
- Dragon Tooth: 18.0
- Havel's Shield: 26.0
- **Total: 94.0/133.3 = 70.5%**

With both rings, you achieve mid-roll. For fast roll, drop shield or use lighter weapon.

## Ring Setup

### Mandatory Rings
1. **Havel's Ring** - +50% equip load
2. **Ring of Favor and Protection** - +20% load

These rings are REQUIRED and cannot be changed.

## Combat Strategy

### PvE Approach
1. Face-tank everything
2. Trade hits freely
3. Poise through attacks
4. Crush with R2s

### PvP Strategy
1. Intimidation factor
2. Hyper armor trades
3. Shield bash mixups
4. Backstab immunity (high poise)

## Alternative Weapons

For weight management:
- **Great Club** - Lighter, S scaling
- **Man-serpent Greatsword** - Fast option
- **Black Knight Sword** - Quality option

## Poise Benefits

121 Poise resists:
- All 1H attacks
- Most 2H attacks
- Multiple hits
- Backstab attempts (sometimes)

## Pros and Cons

### Advantages
- ✓ Highest defense possible
- ✓ Incredible poise
- ✓ Psychological warfare
- ✓ Trivializes PvE

### Disadvantages
- ✗ Extreme stat investment
- ✗ No ring flexibility
- ✗ Weak to magic
- ✗ Slow without fast roll

## Leveling Priority

1. **END to 40** - First priority
2. **STR to 40** - Weapon scaling
3. **VIT to 40** - Survivability
4. **END to 66** - Fast roll goal

## Min-Max Options

### Mid-Roll Version (END 40)
- More stats for VIT/STR
- Still very tanky
- Easier to achieve

### Fashion Alternatives
- Mix Havel's with Giants
- Use Mother Mask
- Stone armor pieces

## Special Techniques

### Shield Bash
- Havel's shield L2
- Deflects spells
- 5 second buff

### Toggle Escape
- Essential for PvP
- Prevents chain BS
- Practice timing

## Lore Compliance

True Havel cosplay:
- Dragon Tooth only
- No pyromancy
- Anti-magic focus
- Crushing strength

## Notes

- Can achieve fast roll at SL 150+
- Consider Great Magic Barrier
- Rock solid vs physical
- Weak to bleed/magic damage
