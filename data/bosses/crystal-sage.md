## Lore
The Crystal Sages are twins who studied under Big Hat Logan, eventually going their separate ways. One guards the path to the Cathedral of the Deep, while the other resides in the Grand Archives. Their mastery of crystal sorcery is second only to Logan himself, though their pursuit of knowledge led them down dark paths.
