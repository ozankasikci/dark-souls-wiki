## Lore
The Undead Settlement's inhabitants, seeking to stave off the curse, performed a ritual transferring their curses into the great tree. Over time, the accumulated curses transformed the tree into a grotesque creature, filled with the writhing forms of those consumed by the curse. The tree stands as a monument to the settlement's desperate attempts to escape their fate.
