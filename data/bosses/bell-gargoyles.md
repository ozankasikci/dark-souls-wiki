## Description
Stone gargoyles that guard the first Bell of Awakening atop the Undead Parish church. The battle begins as a 1v1 fight, but when the first gargoyle reaches 60% health, a second one joins the battle, turning it into a challenging 2v1 encounter.

## Attacks

### Both Gargoyles
- **Horizontal Combo:** Up to three horizontal swipes with halberd
- **Thrust Attack:** Forward thrust with halberd
- **Shield Bash:** Quick bash with shield (first gargoyle only)
- **Overhead Smash:** One or two-handed overhead strike
- **Fire Breath:** Medium-range fire breath attack (more frequent after second joins)

### First Gargoyle Only
- **Flying Overhead Smash:** Flies up and crashes down with overhead attack
- **Tail Swipe:** 360-degree tail sweep when positioned behind

## Strategy

### Preparation
1. Upgrade weapon to +5 if possible
2. Obtain Gold Pine Resin for lightning damage
3. Consider summoning help (Solaire and/or Lautrec)
4. Equip fire-resistant shield (Dragon Crest Shield or Black Knight Shield)

### Fight Tactics
1. **Phase 1 (Single Gargoyle):**
   - Circle with shield raised
   - Attack after it completes combos
   - Cut off tail for Gargoyle Tail Axe (optional)
   - Rush to 50% health to minimize two-gargoyle phase

2. **Phase 2 (Both Gargoyles):**
   - Focus on finishing the first gargoyle quickly
   - Use consumables (firebombs, resin) when second appears
   - Keep both in view to avoid fire breath
   - Use pillars for cover if needed

### Summon Locations
- **Solaire of Astora:** Sign directly in front of fog gate
- **Knight Lautrec:** Sign on ledge behind first ladder (must free him first)

## Drops
- **Guaranteed:** 10,000 Souls (5,000 each), 1 Twin Humanities
- **Tail Cut:** Gargoyle Tail Axe (first gargoyle only)
- **Rare Drops:** 
  - Gargoyle's Halberd
  - Gargoyle Shield
  - Gargoyle Helm

## Tips
- Lightning damage is extremely effective (Gold Pine Resin recommended)
- The roof edge can cause falls - fight in the center
- Second gargoyle spawns damaged if first is below 50% health
- Ranged builds can kite around the roof effectively
- Tail has approximately 78 HP (7.81% of total health)

## Rewards After Victory
- Access to first Bell of Awakening
- 6 Homeward Bones (after ringing bell)
- Opens path to Lower Undead Burg (via key)

## Lore
The Bell Gargoyles serve as eternal guardians of the Bells of Awakening, testing those who would follow the path of the Chosen Undead. Created long ago to protect these sacred bells, they ensure only the worthy can ring them and progress on their journey to link the Fire.
