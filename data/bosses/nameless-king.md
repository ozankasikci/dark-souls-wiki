# Nameless King

Widely considered the hardest boss in Dark Souls III, the Nameless King is the forgotten firstborn son of Gwyn. This optional boss requires finding the secret Archdragon Peak area and presents one of the series' greatest challenges.

## Boss Mechanics

### Phase 1 - King of the Storm
- Fight against drake and rider
- Camera is your greatest enemy
- Drake has separate hitbox
- Lightning AoE attacks
- Flying charge attacks

### Phase 2 - The Nameless King
- Delayed attack patterns
- Extreme lightning damage
- Long range and reach
- Punishes panic rolling
- Near-instant gap closers

## Attack Patterns

### Phase 1 - Drake Attacks
1. **Fire Breath**: Sweeping flame attack
2. **Lightning Spear Throw**: From above
3. **Fly-by Attack**: Charging sweep
4. **Lightning AoE**: Ground lightning burst
5. **Wing Buffet**: Close range knockback

### Phase 2 - Nameless King
1. **Delayed Spear Thrust**: Variable timing
2. **Lightning Stake**: Ground AoE
3. **Falling Bolt**: Jumping lightning slam
4. **Wind Pressure**: Spear sweep with wind
5. **Lightning Storm**: Massive AoE
6. **Grab Attack**: One-shot potential

## Strategy Guide

### Phase 1 Tips
- **Lock-on Issues**: Consider fighting unlocked
- **Hit the Head**: Drake takes bonus damage
- **Stay Close**: Easier to dodge at drake's feet
- **Lightning Defense**: Crucial for survival
- **Save Estus**: Phase 2 is harder

### Phase 2 Mastery
- **Learn Delays**: Don't panic roll
- **Close Distance**: Safer up close
- **Dodge Direction**: Roll forward-right
- **Punish Windows**: After big attacks only
- **Patience**: Marathon, not sprint

## Defensive Preparation

### Recommended Gear
- **Thunder Stoneplate Ring**: Lightning defense
- **Ring of Steel Protection**: Physical defense
- **Lothric Knight Shield**: High lightning block
- **Spirit Tree Crest Shield**: Alternative option

### Armor Considerations
- High lightning resistance priority
- Dragonscale Set excellent choice
- Stay under 70% load
- Fashion souls = death

## Damage Optimization

### Effective Weapons
- **Dark Infused Weapons**: Weakness to dark
- **Human Pine Resin**: Surprisingly effective
- **Dragonslayer Greataxe**: Ironic but good
- **Fast Weapons**: Punish small windows

### Not Recommended
- Lightning damage (immune)
- Slow ultra weapons
- Bleed builds
- Sorcery (hard to cast)

## Attack Delays Breakdown

| Attack | Wind-up | Active | Recovery |
|--------|---------|---------|-----------|
| Thrust | 2.5s | 0.2s | 1.5s |
| Sweep | 1.8s | 0.3s | 1.2s |
| Slam | 3.0s | 0.1s | 2.0s |

## Lore Significance

### The Firstborn's Fall
- Gwyn's eldest son and heir
- God of War, allied with dragons
- Stripped of deific status
- Name erased from history
- Chose dragons over gods

### Environmental Storytelling
- Arena above the clouds
- Storm motifs throughout
- Dragonscale rewards
- Connection to Ornstein

## Speedrun Strategies

### Optimal Route
- Dark resin buffing
- BKS +5 recommended
- Skip Phase 1 quickly
- RTSR possible but risky

### Phase 1 Quick Kill
- Hit drake head exclusively
- Bait fire breath for openings
- 4-5 headshots typically

## Common Mistakes

### What Kills Players
1. **Panic Rolling**: Delayed attacks punish
2. **Greed**: Small punish windows
3. **Camera Lock**: Phase 1 disorientation
4. **Low Lightning Defense**: One-shots
5. **Impatience**: Marathon fight

## Solo vs Summons

### Solo Advantages
- Predictable AI patterns
- Lower boss HP
- Personal achievement
- Easier to dodge

### Summon Considerations
- 50% more HP per phantom
- Unpredictable targeting
- Phase 1 easier
- Phase 2 harder

## Rewards

### Soul Transposition
1. **Lightning Storm**: Miracle AoE
2. **Dragonslayer Swordspear**: Unique weapon
3. **Storm Curved Sword**: Weapon art tornado

### Additional Rewards
- Titanite Slab nearby
- Dragonscale for upgrades
- Access to dragon form
- Ultimate bragging rights
