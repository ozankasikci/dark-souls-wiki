## Lore
Once a noble knight of Irithyll, Vordt was dispatched as an outrider knight by Pontiff Sulyvahn. The rings bestowed upon him by the Pontiff slowly transformed him into a mindless beast, forever bound to guard the wall. His tragic transformation serves as a warning of the Pontiff's cruelty and the fate of those who serve him.
