# Dancer of the Boreal Valley

The Dancer is a mandatory boss with a unique 3/4 rhythm to her attacks, contrasting with the typical 4/4 timing of other bosses. A former daughter of Irithyllian royalty, she was made an Outrider Knight by Pontiff Sulyvahn.

## Unique Characteristics

### Abnormal Attack Rhythm

- Delays catch panic rolls
- Unpredictable for veterans
- Musical boss design
- Requires relearning timing

### Grab Attack

- Long wind-up
- Tracks aggressively
- Life drain animation
- Punishes greed

## Attack Patterns

1. **Triple Slash**: Horizontal sweeps
2. **Thrust**: Long range poke
3. **Grab**: Instant kill threat
4. **Spin Attack**: 360Â° coverage
5. **Ground Stab**: Fire explosion

### Phase 2 Attacks
1. **Dual Sword Spin**: 8+ rotations
2. **Cross Slash**: X pattern
3. **Magic Projectiles**: Dark orbs
4. **Extended Combos**: 5-7 hits
5. **Ground Slam**: AOE explosion

## Phase 2 Spin Attack
