# Capra Demon

The Capra Demon is a boss encountered in the Lower Undead Burg, through the fog gate near the bottom of the stairs. This fight is notorious for its small arena and the presence of two attack dogs that rush the player immediately upon entering.

## Strategy

### Phase 1
The key to this fight is surviving the first few seconds. Upon entering the fog gate, immediately dodge or block the initial attacks from both the Capra Demon and its two dogs. The confined space makes this particularly challenging.

**Tips:**
- Kill the dogs first - they have low health but can stun-lock you
- Use the stairs on the left side of the arena to create distance
- The Capra Demon cannot reach you at the very top of the stairs
- Plunging attacks from the stairs deal significant damage

### Weaknesses
- Vulnerable to fire damage
- Can be staggered with heavy weapons
- The narrow arena can work in your favor with proper positioning

## Drops
- Key to the Depths
- 6000 Souls
- 1 Humanity
- 1 Homeward Bone

## Notes
- One of the most challenging early-game bosses due to the cramped arena
- The dogs respawn if you die but remain dead if you die after killing them
- Using poise or high stability shields helps significantly
