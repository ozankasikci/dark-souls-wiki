## Description
A minotaur-like demon found atop a narrow castle wall in the Undead Burg, blocking the path to the Undead Parish. Covered in brown fur with yellow eyes, large horns protrude from its skeletal head. The Taurus Demon wields a massive Demon's Greataxe carved from the bones of fellow demons.

## Attacks
- **Horizontal Swing:** Wide horizontal arc attack with moderate range. Telegraphed by drawing the weapon back
- **Jump Attack:** Leaps forward with a vertical smash when at medium range
- **Vertical Smash:** Overhead strike with long, obvious windup
- **Tower Jump:** If the player stays on the archer tower too long, it will jump up, potentially knocking you off

## Strategy

### Preparation
1. Clear the two hollow archers on the tower before engaging
2. Apply Gold Pine Resin for lightning damage (very effective)
3. Consider using firebombs or ranged attacks

### Plunging Attack Method (Recommended)
1. Trigger the boss by passing through the fog gate
2. Immediately turn right and climb the ladder
3. Lure the demon close to the tower
4. Drop down and perform a plunging attack (removes ~1/3 health)
5. Repeat 2-3 times for victory

### Melee Strategy
- Run between the demon's legs to avoid attacks
- Stay close to limit its moveset
- Watch for the obvious attack windups
- Back away during attacks, then counter

### Cheese Strategies
1. **Fall Method:** Position yourself at the edge of the bridge and bait the demon to jump backwards off the edge
2. **Ranged:** Maintain distance and use spells/arrows between its slow attacks

## Drops
- **Guaranteed:** 3,000 Souls, 1 Humanity
- **Rare Drop:** Demon's Greataxe

## Tips
- Gold Pine Resin makes this fight significantly easier
- The narrow bridge works to your advantage - limited dodging needed
- Black Knight weapons deal 20% extra damage (classified as Chaos Demon)
- Can be skipped entirely with Master Key via Darkroot Basin

## Lore
The Taurus Demons are lesser demons spawned from the Bed of Chaos, created when the Witch of Izalith attempted to recreate the First Flame using her Lord Soul. These demons now guard various passages throughout Lordran, remnants of the failed experiment that birthed the demons of chaos.
