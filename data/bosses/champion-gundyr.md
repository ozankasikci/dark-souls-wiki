# Champion Gundyr

Champion Gundyr represents Iudex Gundyr in his prime - before failing his duty and becoming a sheath for the coiled sword. This optional boss is one of the most aggressive in the game, relentlessly pressuring players with minimal downtime.

## Boss Characteristics

3. **Thrust**: Long range poke

5. **Running Sweep**: Gap closer

### Unique Attacks
1. **Kick**: Guardbreak, parryable
2. **Shoulder Charge**: Unparryable
