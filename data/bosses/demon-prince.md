The Demon Prince serves as the first boss of The Ringed City DLC, featuring a challenging two-phase encounter. Players must first defeat the Demon in Pain and Demon from Below simultaneously before facing their combined form.

### Toxic Build-up
- Both can inflict toxic
- Builds up quickly
- Massive DOT damage

## Phase 2 - Demon Prince

### Fusion Mechanic

- Both versions dangerous
- Laser vs Meteor variants

### Version 1 - Laser Prince
(If Demon in Pain dies last)

### Best Options
1. **Black Knight Weapons**: +20% damage
2. **Bleed Builds**: Quick procs
3. **Dark Damage**: Effective

5. **Resource Waste**: Need for P2
