# Pontiff Sulyvahn

Pontiff Sulyvahn serves as a major skill check in Dark Souls III, testing players' ability to handle hyper-aggressive bosses. His relentless combos and phantom mechanic make him one of the most challenging mandatory bosses.

## Combat Overview

### Dual Swords
- **Profaned Greatsword**: Fire damage (right hand)
- **Greatsword of Judgment**: Magic damage (left hand)
- Combos mix both damage types
- Different swing patterns
- Extended reach

### Phase Transition
- At 50% HP summons phantom
- Phantom telegraphs attacks
- Must manage two enemies
- Phantom can be killed
- Different strategies emerge

## Attack Patterns

### Phase 1 Combos
1. **7-Hit Combo**: Alternating swords
2. **Thrust → Slam**: Gap closer
3. **Spinning Slash**: 360° coverage
4. **Leaping Slam**: Both swords
5. **Fire Trail**: Profaned sword drag

### Phase 2 Additions
- Phantom performs attack first
- Main body follows 1-2 seconds later
- Can desync if damaged
- Double the attacks
- Positional advantage lost

## Parry Guide

### Parryable Attacks
- Opening lunge (easiest)
- First swing of combos
- Single sword swings
- NOT jumping attacks
- NOT magic projectiles

### Parry Timing
| Attack | Parry Window |
|--------|--------------|
| Lunge | Very early |
| Overhead | On descent |
| Horizontal | Mid-swing |
| Thrust | On extension |

## Strategy Options

### Aggressive Approach
- Stay close
- Punish every opening
- Don't let him breathe
- Kill phantom quickly
- High risk/reward

### Defensive Approach
- Bait single attacks
- Use pillars
- Manage stamina
- Chip damage
- Longer but safer

### Parry Route
- Master opening lunge
- One-shot potential
- Requires practice
- High skill ceiling
- Speedrun strategy

## Build Recommendations

### STR Builds
- Greatshields work well
- Trade with hyperarmor
- Stunlock potential
- Heavy weapons viable

### DEX Builds
- Fast weapons essential
- Bleed somewhat effective
- Dodge focused
- Punish windows small

### Magic Builds
- Difficult fight
- Limited cast windows
- Melee backup needed
- Not recommended

## Phantom Mechanics

### Clone Properties
- Same HP as main body
- Telegraphs all attacks
- Can be targeted separately
- Respawns if only clone killed
- Desyncs create openings

### Managing Both
1. Watch phantom first
2. React to telegraph
3. Position between them
4. AOE attacks helpful
5. Focus main body

## Arena Usage

### Environmental Help
- Pillars block projectiles
- Corners limit movement
- Stairs create spacing
- Use full arena
- Don't get cornered

## Lore Significance

### The Usurper
- Corrupted by Profaned Flame
- Conquered Irithyll
- Fed Gwyndolin to Aldrich
- Imprisoned Yorshka
- Tyrant of the city

### Outrider Knights
- Created his knights
- Gave them Pontiff's rings
- Sent to far lands
- Eventual madness
- Vordt and Dancer

## Summons Available

### NPCs
- **Anri of Astora**: If quest active
- **Black Hand Gotthard**: Always available
- **Londor Pale Shade**: Yuria quest

### Summon Strategy
- Makes fight easier
- Phantom phase chaotic
- Less predictable
- More HP on boss

## Common Mistakes

### What Kills Players
1. **Panic Rolling**: Into combos
2. **Greed**: During combos
3. **Ignoring Phantom**: Phase 2
4. **Bad Positioning**: Corner deaths
5. **Stamina Mismanagement**: No escape

## Rewards

### Soul Transposition
1. **Profaned Greatsword**: Fire UGS
2. **Greatsword of Judgment**: INT weapon

### Progression
- Access to Anor Londo
- Aldrich boss fight
- Giant's area
- Yorksha's tower

## Speedrun Tech

### Parry Route
- Guaranteed opening parry
- RTSR setup
- Hornet ring
- One-cycle possible

### No Parry Route
- Bleed weapons
- Stay aggressive
- Sub-2 minute fight
- Requires perfection

## Challenge Runs

### SL1 Strategy
- Parry essential
- Raw Broadsword +7
- Lloyd's rings
- Perfect spacing

### No-Hit Requirements
- Master all patterns
- Phantom phase crucial
- Positioning key
- Patience required

## Community Perception

### Difficulty Spike
- First major wall
- Skill check boss
- Separates casual/serious
- Preparation required

### Fair but Hard
- All attacks telegraphed
- Multiple strategies
- Rewards mastery
- Iconic encounter
