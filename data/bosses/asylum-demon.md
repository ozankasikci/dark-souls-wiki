## Description
The Asylum Demon is a lesser demon who guards the Undead Asylum, preventing the prisoners within from escaping. It is the first boss encountered in Dark Souls, serving as a tutorial for the game's boss mechanics. The demon wields a massive Demon's Great Hammer molded from stone archtrees.

## Attacks
- **Hammer Swing Combo:** A series of horizontal swings with moderate tracking
- **Overhead Hammer Smash:** Powerful downward strike with a small AoE
- **Flying Butt Slam:** Flies up and crashes down, creating a shockwave
- **Side Sweeps:** Quick attacks to either side when the player is flanking

## Strategy

### First Encounter
During your initial meeting, you'll likely have only a broken sword hilt. It's recommended to run through the door on the left rather than attempting to fight.

### Second Encounter
1. **Plunging Attack:** Start with a plunging attack from the ledge above for massive damage (approximately 1/4 of its health)
2. **Stay Close:** Remaining near the demon limits its attack options
3. **Circle Behind:** Position yourself behind its left leg - when it turns, it will push you along, allowing continuous attacks
4. **Avoid Distance:** At range, the demon uses wide-arc attacks that are difficult to dodge

### Tips
- Black Firebombs (starting gift) can defeat the demon quickly
- The demon is slow and heavily telegraphs its attacks
- Most attacks can be avoided by staying behind it
- Strike weapons and fire damage are particularly effective

## Drops
- **Standard Victory:** 
  - 2,000 Souls
  - Big Pilgrim's Key
- **First Encounter Victory:** 
  - Demon's Great Hammer
  - Big Pilgrim's Key (given by Oscar instead)

## Notes
- Defeating the Asylum Demon on the first encounter (without proper weapons) rewards the Demon's Great Hammer
- The fight teaches fundamental boss mechanics: positioning, stamina management, and attack patterns
- Returns later as the Stray Demon, a much stronger variant

## Lore
The Asylum Demon serves as the gatekeeper of the Northern Undead Asylum, where undead are imprisoned to await the end of the world. Its presence ensures that the prophecy of the Chosen Undead can only be fulfilled by one strong enough to escape.
