# Lothric, Younger Prince

The Twin Princes represent the final Lord of Cinder, with Lothric refusing to link the fire and his older brother Lorian protecting him. This unique dual boss features resurrection mechanics and requires defeating both brothers.

## Boss Mechanics

### The Twin Dynamic
- Lorian (older): Melee fighter
- Lothric (younger): Magic support
- Lothric can revive Lorian
- Must kill both quickly
- Shared health bar

### Teleportation
- Lorian teleports frequently
- Appears behind player
- Instant transmission
- No telegraph
- Disorienting effect

## Phase Breakdown

### Phase 1 - Lorian Alone
- Crippled but powerful
- Crawls and teleports
- Fire-infused sword
- Wide sweeping attacks
- Learning phase

### Phase 2 - Twin Princes
- Lothric rides Lorian's back
- Magic projectiles added
- Resurrection ability
- Teleport attacks
- Coordinated assault

## Attack Patterns

### Lorian's Moveset
1. **Triple Slam**: Overhead combos
2. **Horizontal Sweep**: Wide arc
3. **Teleport Slam**: From above
4. **Fire Wave**: Ground projectile
5. **Charged Thrust**: Long wind-up

### Lothric's Abilities
1. **Soul Spear**: Fast projectile
2. **Homing Soulmass**: Tracking orbs
3. **Resurrection**: Revives Lorian

## Build Effectiveness

### Strong Against Princes
