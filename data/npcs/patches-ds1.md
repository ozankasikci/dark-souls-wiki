# Patches

*"I'm Patches. Trusty Patches. You know, treasure hunter, adventurer... Let's be friends!"*

Patches the Hyena is a recurring character throughout the Souls series, infamous for his treacherous nature and penchant for kicking unsuspecting victims into deadly pits. Despite his hostile actions, he becomes a useful merchant if forgiven.

## Character Overview

Patches is a bald, scheming trickster who claims to be a treasure hunter but makes his living by tricking greedy adventurers to their doom and looting their corpses. He has an intense hatred for clerics and the devout, seeing them as hypocritical and sanctimonious. His character represents the base nature of humanity - greed, self-preservation, and opportunism.

## Dialogue

### First Meeting (Catacombs)
*"Are you a Cleric or something?"*
- Answer "Yes": *"I HATE Clerics! And you're gonna pay!"* (becomes hostile)
- Answer "No": *"Good. I'm not too fond of Clerics. Alright then, let's try to help each other out."*

### After Bridge Trap
*"Oh, it's you... You give me quite a scare. I did you wrong. But, I didn't mean it. These ruins got the best of me. I was just poking around for treasure, you know. But I've had a change of heart. I'll be leaving this place soon. Maybe we'll run into each other again. What do you say? Can you forgive me?"*

### After Tomb Kick
*"Well, what do we have here? You must be a new arrival. Let me guess. Fate of the Undead, right? Well, you're not the first! But there's no salvation here. You'd have done better to rot in the Undead Asylum... But, too late now."*

### On Clerics
*"I hate Clerics more than anything... Always praying. Always preaching. And always judging others. What good are Gods if they ain't gonna help us?"*

## Lore Implications

### Nature of Humanity
Patches represents the base instincts of humanity:
- Greed and opportunism
- Self-preservation at any cost
- Distrust of authority and religion
- The will to survive by any means

### Relationship with Religion
His hatred of clerics stems from:
- Seeing religious hypocrisy
- Resentment of divine authority
- Practical atheism in a world of absent gods
- Viewing faith as weakness to exploit

## Tips

1. **Never admit to being a cleric** - This makes him permanently hostile
2. **Forgive him for merchant access** - His inventory is valuable
3. **Watch for his traps** - Always suspicious near cliff edges
4. **Don't attack unless necessary** - Better as a merchant than dead
5. **Buy Humanity** - Cheaper than farming in some cases

## The Flip Trap

To survive the Catacombs bridge flip:
- Have high HP
- Wear Fall Control or Silvercat Ring
- Land on the lower platform carefully
- Quit/reload to reset the bridge

## Trivia

- His bald head and distinctive voice make him instantly recognizable
- The only character to appear in nearly every Souls game
- His kick animation is unique among NPCs
- Voice actor William Vanderpuye brings distinctive personality
- Often positioned near valuable treasure as bait
- His survival across games suggests cunning beyond normal humans
- May be inspired by Patches O'Houlihan from "Dodgeball"

## Notable Quotes
