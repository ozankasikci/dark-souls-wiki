# Oscar of Astora

*"Thou who art Undead, art chosen..."*

Oscar of Astora is the Elite Knight who drops the key to your cell in the Undead Asylum, beginning your journey. His noble sacrifice and final words set the entire adventure in motion.

## Character Overview

Oscar is a knight from Astora who embarked on a pilgrimage to fulfill an ancient prophecy. He wears the iconic Elite Knight set that has become synonymous with Dark Souls, appearing in promotional material and cover art. Though his role is brief, his impact on the story is immeasurable.

## Story & Encounters

### First Encounter - Your Liberation
Oscar first appears by dropping a corpse with the Dungeon Cell Key into your cell, allowing you to escape. This act of kindness costs him dearly.

### Second Encounter - Fateful Meeting
After obtaining your equipment and making your way through the asylum, you find Oscar mortally wounded:
- He was injured by the Asylum Demon during his attempt to escape
- Gives you the Estus Flask and Undead Asylum F2 East Key
- Shares the prophecy that drives the game's narrative
- Dies after passing his mission to you

### Return Visit - Hollow Oscar
If you return to the Undead Asylum later:
- Oscar has gone hollow and become hostile
- He uses Astora's Straight Sword and Crest Shield
- Casts healing miracles
- Drops Crest Shield when defeated

## The Prophecy

Oscar shares the ancient prophecy of his family:

*"Thou who art Undead, art chosen... In thine exodus from the Undead Asylum, maketh pilgrimage to the land of Ancient Lords... When thou ringeth the Bell of Awakening, the fate of the Undead thou shalt know."*

This prophecy becomes your primary motivation and quest throughout the game.

## Dialogue

### When Found Wounded
*"Oh, you... You're no Hollow, eh? Thank goodness... I'm done for, I'm afraid... I'll die soon, then lose my sanity... I wish to ask something of you... You and I, we're both Undead... Hear me out, will you?"*

### Passing the Torch
*"Regrettably, I have failed in my mission... But perhaps you can keep the torch lit... There is an old saying in my family... Now I must bid farewell... I would hate to harm you after death... So, go now... And thank you..."*

### If You Return Without Taking His Items
*"Oh, you... You're no Hollow yet, are you? Thank Heaven... I am Oscar of Astora... I am not long for this world... But before I go, I shall... Oh...!"* (dies)

### As a Hollow (Return Visit)
No dialogue - attacks on sight with aggressive swordsmanship

## Equipment

### Elite Knight Set
Oscar wears the complete set:
- Elite Knight Helm
- Elite Knight Armor  
- Elite Knight Gauntlets
- Elite Knight Leggings

This armor provides excellent physical defense and poise while maintaining reasonable weight.

### Weapons
- **Astora's Straight Sword**: A blessed weapon that scales with Faith
- **Crest Shield**: 100% physical block with excellent magic defense

## Combat (Hollow Form)

When encountered as a hollow:
- Uses Astora's Straight Sword effectively
- Can parry and riposte
- Heals with miracles
- More aggressive than his living personality would suggest
- Retains combat skills despite hollowing

## Lore Implications

### The Chosen Undead
- Oscar believed he was the Chosen Undead
- His failure and your success raises questions about fate vs. chance
- Multiple "chosen" may exist across parallel worlds
- The prophecy may be propaganda rather than truth

### Family Heritage
- Comes from a noble family in Astora
- The prophecy was passed down through generations
- His family clearly had connections to the Way of White
- Astora has a tradition of producing holy knights

### Cut Content
In cut content, Oscar would have:
- Survived the asylum
- Appeared throughout your journey
- Potentially become a rival depending on choices
- Had a more complex relationship with the player

## Connection to Other Characters

### Astora Natives
- **Solaire of Astora**: Fellow countryman with different goals
- **Anastacia of Astora**: The Fire Keeper shares his homeland
- **Prince Ricard**: Another noble from Astora

## Symbolism

Oscar represents:
- The passing of destiny from one to another
- The arbitrary nature of being "chosen"
- Noble sacrifice and selflessness
- The thin line between purpose and hollowing

## Impact on Gaming

- His armor became the iconic "face" of Dark Souls
- The opening rescue scene is one of gaming's memorable moments
- Established the tradition of tragic NPCs in Souls games
- His death teaches the player about the world's harsh reality

## Tips

1. Don't forget to return for the Crest Shield
2. His hollow form is tougher than expected
3. The East Key he drops is essential for progression
4. Listen to all his dialogue for lore
5. His equipment is excellent for Faith builds

## Trivia

- Originally planned as a recurring character
- His armor appears in all Dark Souls games
- The corpse he drops has the key - was it another failed undead?
- His shield bears the emblem of Astora
- Voice actor Oliver Le Sueur gave him a noble, weary tone
