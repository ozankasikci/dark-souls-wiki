# Ludleth of Courland

Ludleth of Courland is an exiled Lord of Cinder who linked the First Flame long ago. Despite his small stature, he willingly returns to his throne in Firelink Shrine and serves as the soul transposition merchant.

## Location

- **Always Found**: On his throne in Firelink Shrine (the leftmost throne when facing them)
- Remains on his throne throughout the game unless killed

## Services

### Soul Transposition
After giving him the **Transposing Kiln**, Ludleth can transpose boss souls into:
- Unique weapons
- Unique spells
- Unique rings

## Dialogue

### First Meeting
*"Ahh, well met. I am Ludleth of Courland. Alas, I am but a small lord, unfit to be a cinder. But for the sake of the Lords, and for Firelink, I am willing to play my part."*

### About Linking the Fire
*"I linked the fire long ago, and became a Lord of Cinder. But that is a tale of long ago, and I am but a small lord."*

### About Soul Transposition
*"This Lordvessel will restore the Transposing Kiln. Place it upon my lap, and I will show you the true power of a lord."*

## Key Item

**Transposing Kiln** - Found after defeating the Curse-rotted Greatwood
- Required to unlock soul transposition services

## Transposable Boss Souls

### Notable Transpositions
- **Soul of the Rotted Greatwood** → Hollowslayer Greatsword or Arstor's Spear

## Lore

### Background
- Exiled from Courland for unknown reasons
- One of the few Lords who willingly returned to their throne
- Implied to have linked the fire through unconventional means
- Created the Skull Ring, which draws enemy aggression

### The Skull Ring
When killed, Ludleth drops his own creation:
- **Skull Ring**: "Ring made from a shattered skull. Increases souls gained from defeated enemies, but also makes the wearer easier to detect."

## Secret Dialogue

### Firekeeper's Eyes
If you give the Fire Keeper the eyes and talk to Ludleth:
*"Ahh, found her, did we? And the black eyes that shimmer within, I see? Tis as if it were but yesterday. We did all we could to spare her from them."*

### After Killing Him
If killed and revived:
*"Knowest thou not? I am a Lord of Cinder. I am immune to death. Didst thou not see my throne?"*

## Combat Information

- Cannot move from his throne
- Will respawn after resting at a bonfire
- Drops 1,000 souls when killed

## Notes

- The only Lord of Cinder who stays on his throne willingly

- Has unique dialogue for many boss souls

## Trivia

- His legless state is never explained in-game
- The word "Ludleth" may derive from "little" or "ludus" (Latin for game/sport)
- One of the most helpful NPCs, never betraying or leaving the player
- His skull ring suggests a connection to death and suffering
