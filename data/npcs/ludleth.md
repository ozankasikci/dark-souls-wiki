# Ludleth of Courland

Ludleth of Courland is an exiled Lord of Cinder who linked the First Flame long ago. Despite his small stature, he willingly returns to his throne in Firelink Shrine and serves as the soul transposition merchant.

## Location

- **Firelink Shrine** - Sitting on one of the five thrones, farthest on the left

## Soul Transposition

Ludleth is the NPC who performs Soul Transposition, allowing you to convert boss souls into:
- Weapons
- Spells
- Rings

To unlock this service, you must bring him the **Transposing Kiln** found in the Undead Settlement.

## Dialogue

### First Meeting
> "Oh, thou'rt Unkindled, and a seeker of Lords. I am Ludleth of Courland. Look not in bewilderment as I say... I linked the fire long ago, becoming a Lord of Cinder."

### About Linking the Fire
> "I may be but small, but I will die a colossus."

## Notes

- One of the five Lords of Cinder
- The only Lord who willingly returned to his throne
- Cannot be killed permanently - respawns after resting at bonfire
- His throne remains even after he dies
