## Dialogue Highlights

*"Ah, you must be a new arrival. Let me guess... Fate of the Undead, right? Well, you're not the first. But there's no salvation here. You'd have done better to rot in the Undead Asylum... But, too late now."*

*"I'm the blacksmith of these parts. If you have need, I'll be happy to smith whatever you like. Give it some time, and I'm sure you'll find good weapons."*

*"This crest opens a door in the Darkroot Garden. The door leads to a dangerous place filled with warriors and great treasures."*
