# Anastacia of Astora (Fire Keeper)

## Description
Anastacia of Astora is the Fire Keeper of Firelink Shrine. She is a mute woman imprisoned below the bonfire, her tongue removed as part of her duty. She cannot speak, only gesturing when the player approaches.

## Location
- **Firelink Shrine**: In a cell beneath the bonfire, accessed through an alcove behind the shrine

## Role

### Estus Flask Reinforcement
- Give her **Fire Keeper Souls** to increase the potency of your Estus Flask
- Each soul upgrades the flask by one level (up to +7)
- More HP restored per use with each upgrade

## Questline

### Lautrec's Betrayal
1. **Knight Lautrec** is rescued from Undead Parish
2. Lautrec kills Anastacia and steals her soul
3. Firelink Shrine bonfire goes out
4. Use Black Eye Orb in Anor Londo to invade Lautrec's world
5. Defeat Lautrec to recover Fire Keeper Soul
6. Return the soul to revive Anastacia

### Consequences of Her Death
- Firelink Shrine bonfire cannot be used
- Cannot upgrade Estus Flask until she's revived
- Severely impacts early-mid game convenience

### Revival
- Place her soul on her corpse to revive her
- She will speak for the first and only time, thanking you
- Bonfire is restored and Estus upgrades resume

## Fire Keeper Souls

Anastacia accepts these souls to upgrade your Estus:
1. **Undead Parish** - Church near the Channeler
2. **Blighttown** - Corpse near the rotating bridge
3. **New Londo Ruins** - Behind an illusory wall
4. **Duke's Archives** - In a chest
5. **Quelaag's Domain** - From the spider lady (don't give to Anastacia)
6. **Anastacia's Soul** - Recovered from Lautrec
7. **Darkmoon Knightess** - Anor Londo (if killed)
