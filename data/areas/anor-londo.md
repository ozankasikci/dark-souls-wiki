# Anor Londo

> *"The legendary city of the gods, built by Lord Gwyn at the dawn of the Age of Fire."*

Anor Londo stands as the crown jewel of Lordran - a magnificent city that once housed the gods themselves. As one of the only non-ruined areas in the game, its pristine architecture and golden sunlight create a stark contrast to the decay found elsewhere.

## History

Built by Lord Gwyn at the dawn of the Age of Fire, Anor Londo served as his throne and the seat of power for the gods. When Gwyn departed to link the Fire, he took half his Silver Knight army with him, leaving the rest to defend the city under an illusion of prosperity.

## Architecture

The city's design draws heavy inspiration from real European landmarks:
- Interior structures mirror the Ch√¢teau de Chambord in France
- Exterior architecture based on Milan Cathedral in Italy
- Massive cathedral serves as the centerpiece
- Rotating bridge mechanism controls access to different areas

## Enemies

### Silver Knights
These loyal guardians remained in Anor Londo to defend the illusory goddess. They wield:
- Silver Knight Straight Sword
- Silver Knight Spear
- Dragonslayer Greatbow

The archer knights positioned on the narrow ledges have become infamous among players for their deadly precision.

### Sentinels
Massive armored guardians that patrol the cathedral's main hall. Their size and reach make them formidable opponents in close quarters.

### Bat Wing Demons
These creatures serve as both enemies and transportation, carrying the Chosen Undead from Sen's Fortress to Anor Londo.

## Key Areas

### The Great Cathedral
The main structure houses:
- The legendary boss fight against Ornstein and Smough
- Princess Gwynevere's chamber
- Multiple Silver Knight patrols
- Hidden passages and treasure rooms

### The Giant Blacksmith
Located in a side chamber, this gentle giant offers:
- Unique weapon upgrades
- Lightning and Crystal paths
- Boss weapon creation

### The Painted World
A mysterious painting in the cathedral leads to the Painted World of Ariamis - a completely separate area housing unique enemies and treasures.

## The Ornstein and Smough Battle

Dragonslayer Ornstein and Executioner Smough form the last line of defense before Princess Gwynevere. This dual boss fight is considered one of the series' most challenging and iconic encounters:

- Ornstein: Swift and aggressive with lightning attacks
- Smough: Slow but devastating with his massive hammer
- Defeating one empowers the other
- Different rewards based on kill order

## The Illusion

Princess Gwynevere, Gwyn's daughter, appears as a gentle giant who gifts the Lordvessel. However:
- She is merely an illusion created by Dark Sun Gwyndolin
- Destroying the illusion plunges Anor Londo into darkness
- The city's true abandoned state is revealed
- Most enemies vanish, but Silver Knights remain

## Notable Items

- **Lordvessel**: Essential item for game progression
- **Silver Knight Set**: Elegant armor with high defense
- **Hawk Ring**: Extends bow range significantly
- **Leo Ring**: Boosts counter damage

## Tips

- The infamous archer section can be cheesed with poison arrows
- Summoning Solaire makes the O&S fight more manageable
- The Giant Blacksmith is the only source for certain upgrades
- Hidden walls conceal valuable treasures
- The painted world is entirely optional but worth exploring

## Lore Significance

Anor Londo represents the height of the Age of Fire's glory and its current facade masks the reality of the gods' abandonment. The city stands as a monument to a golden age that has long since passed, maintained only through Gwyndolin's desperate illusions.
