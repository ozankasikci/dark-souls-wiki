# New Londo Ruins

## Overview
New Londo Ruins is a haunted, partially flooded city that was sacrificed to contain the spread of the Abyss. Once a thriving city of culture and sorcery, it now stands as a testament to the desperate measures taken to prevent catastrophe. The city is unique in having no bonfire, making it one of the most challenging areas to navigate.

## History
New Londo was once a proud human city, home to skilled blacksmiths and sorcerers. When the Four Kings fell to the Dark and the Abyss began to spread, the city was flooded by the sealers, drowning its entire population to contain the threat. The victims became ghosts, forever haunting the ruins.

## Layout
- **Upper Ruins**: Ghost-infested buildings and walkways
- **Lower New Londo**: Accessible after draining the water
- **Darkwraith Territory**: The deepest sections where Darkwraiths patrol
- **The Abyss**: Portal to the Four Kings boss fight

## Unique Mechanics

### Ghost Combat
Ghosts can only be damaged when:
- Using a Transient Curse item (lasts 5 minutes)
- While actually cursed
- Using a cursed weapon

### Water Drainage
The city remains flooded until you obtain the Key to the Seal from Ingward or kill him. Activating the seal mechanism drains the lower city, revealing the path to the Four Kings.

## NPCs
- **Ingward**: Leader of the Sealers, guards the key to drain the city
- **Rickert of Vinheim**: Blacksmith trapped behind bars, specializes in magic upgrades

## Boss: Four Kings
Former rulers of New Londo who were seduced by the Abyss. This DPS race takes place in the Abyss itself, requiring the Covenant of Artorias ring to survive. Kings spawn on a timer, making high damage output essential.

## Notable Items
- **Key to the Seal**: Drains the water from lower New Londo
- **Very Large Ember**: Allows +15 weapon upgrades
- **Cursebite Ring**: Increases curse resistance
- **Dark Hand**: Darkwraith weapon that can steal humanity

## Enemies
- **Ghosts**: Can phase through walls and inflict curse buildup
- **Darkwraiths**: Elite enemies that drop titanite chunks and Dark Hand
- **Mass of Souls**: Explosive skull clusters in the lower ruins

## Access Routes
- **From Firelink Shrine**: Elevator down to the ruins
- **From Valley of Drakes**: Through the large gate (requires water drainage)
- **To The Abyss**: Circular pit after draining water

## Strategy Tips
- Stock up on Transient Curses before entering
- No bonfire means planning your route carefully
- Ghosts drop more Transient Curses
- Darkwraiths are excellent for farming titanite chunks
- Wear the Covenant of Artorias ring before dropping into the Abyss

## Lore
New Londo's tragedy exemplifies the desperate measures taken during the war against the Dark. The city's flooding saved Lordran from the Abyss but at the cost of countless innocent lives. The Four Kings' fall from wise rulers to servants of the Dark parallels the broader decay affecting the world.
