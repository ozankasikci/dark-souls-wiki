# Sen's Fortress

> *"An ancient proving ground filled with deadly traps, built to test the worthy before they reach the city of gods."*

Sen's Fortress stands as the gateway to Anor Londo, a massive trap-filled stronghold that opens only after both Bells of Awakening have been rung. This vertical gauntlet tests every skill learned thus far.
