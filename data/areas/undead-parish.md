# Undead Parish

## Overview
The Undead Parish houses the first Bell of Awakening atop its cathedral. This area serves as a major hub, connecting to multiple important locations and housing Andre the blacksmith. The parish church stands as a testament to the fading glory of the Way of White.

## Layout
The area consists of:
- Lower parish grounds with hollow soldiers
- Main cathedral with multiple levels
- Bell tower accessed via church rooftop
- Side passages leading to various connections
- Blacksmith area beneath the parish

## Key Features

### The Cathedral
A grand structure now overrun with hollows and protected by elite Balder Knights. A Berenike Knight guards the main altar, while a Channeler surveys from above.

### First Bell of Awakening
Atop the church roof, guarded by the Bell Gargoyles. Ringing this bell is one of two requirements to open Sen's Fortress.

### Andre's Workshop
The legendary blacksmith Andre has set up shop in the basement, offering weapon upgrades and selling titanite shards.

## NPCs
- **Andre of Astora**: Essential blacksmith for weapon upgrades
- **Oswald of Carim**: Pardoner who absolves sins (appears after ringing bell)
- **Lautrec of Carim**: Suspicious knight imprisoned in the church

## Boss: Bell Gargoyles
Twin gargoyles that attack with fire breath and halberd swings. The second gargoyle joins when the first reaches half health. Their defeat allows access to the first bell.

## Connections
- **Undead Burg**: Via the bridge and tower
- **Darkroot Garden**: Through Andre's workshop
- **Sen's Fortress**: Gate opens after both bells are rung
- **Lower Undead Burg**: Via locked door near the church

## Notable Enemies
- **Titanite Demon**: Optional mini-boss guarding valuable upgrade materials
- **Channeler**: Sorcerer that buffs nearby hollows
- **Balder Knights**: Skilled swordsmen with excellent parrying abilities

## Lore
The parish represents the height of the Way of White's influence in Lordran. The cathedral's dedication to the gods and its bell's role in the prophecy of the Chosen Undead make it a crucial location in the pilgrimage.
