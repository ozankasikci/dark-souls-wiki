# Valley of Drakes

## Overview
The Valley of Drakes is a narrow ravine that serves as a crucial connection point between several major areas. This optional area contains no bonfire and is populated by dangerous drake enemies, making it a high-risk shortcut for experienced players.

## Purpose
While the valley can be entirely avoided, it serves several important functions:
- Early access to Blighttown (with Master Key)
- Shortcut between multiple areas
- Houses important items for specific builds
- Contains upgrade materials

## Layout
- **Entrance Bridge**: From New Londo Ruins gate
- **Drake Bridge**: Narrow bridge with drake ambushes
- **Undead Dragon Bridge**: Where the slumbering dragon rests
- **Cave Passages**: Connecting to Darkroot Basin and Blighttown

## Enemies

### Drakes
These blue, lightning-breathing dragons are smaller than their ancient kin but still formidable. They have high health and their lightning breath can quickly kill unprepared players. Fighting them is usually not worth the risk early game.

### Undead Dragon
A massive dragon corpse blocks one bridge. While mostly passive, it will poison bite if you get too close to its head. Its tail can be cut for the Dragon Scale item.

## Notable Items
- **Dragon Crest Shield**: Excellent fire resistance shield on a corpse
- **Astora's Straight Sword**: Faith-scaling weapon near the Undead Dragon
- **Red Tearstone Ring**: Boosts attack when health is critical
- **Brigand Set**: Light armor set with good resistances

## Connections
- **New Londo Ruins**: Through the sealed gate
- **Blighttown**: Via cave entrance (Master Key required)
- **Darkroot Basin**: Through the cave system

## Master Key Advantage
Having the Master Key starting gift allows:
- Skipping the Depths entirely
- Early access to Blighttown's back entrance
- Quick farming routes
- Sequence breaking opportunities

## Strategy Tips
- Drakes are best avoided early game
- Sprint past enemies rather than fighting
- The Undead Dragon won't attack if you avoid its head
- Use ranged attacks to safely aggro drakes
- No bonfire means planning your route carefully

## Speedrun Relevance
The Valley of Drakes is crucial for many speedrun routes, allowing players to:
- Skip Lower Undead Burg and Depths
- Access Blighttown immediately
- Quickly reach Quelaag for the second bell

## Lore
The presence of drakes suggests this valley may have once been a nesting ground for dragons. The undead dragon's massive size indicates it may have been an ancient dragon, now reduced to a poisonous corpse. The valley's strategic position between areas makes it both a useful passage and a dangerous gauntlet.
