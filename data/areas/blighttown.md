# Blighttown

> *"The first taste of poison swamps for many players - a plague-ridden settlement that tests patience and preparation."*

Blighttown has earned its reputation as one of Dark Souls' most challenging and frustrating areas. This vertical shantytown descends into a poisonous swamp, combining environmental hazards with aggressive enemies and the infamous framerate issues that plagued the original release.

## Overview

Built within a massive cavern, Blighttown consists of two distinct sections:
- **Upper Blighttown**: Wooden scaffolding and platforms
- **Lower Blighttown**: The poisonous swamp floor

The area serves as a major progression gate, housing the second Bell of Awakening beyond Chaos Witch Quelaag.

## Environmental Hazards

### Poison Swamp
The lower section's defining feature:
- Inflicts poison status on contact
- Dramatically slows movement speed
- Poison doesn't stack once afflicted
- High poison resistance recommended
- Purple Moss Clumps essential

### Toxic Blowdarts
Upper section's deadliest threat:
- Inflicted by Blowdart Snipers
- Much deadlier than regular poison
- Snipers don't respawn once killed
- Blooming Purple Moss Clumps cure toxin

## Notable Enemies

### Infested Barbarians
- Wield massive clubs
- Deal tremendous damage
- Can knock players off platforms
- Drop Large Titanite Shards

### Blowdart Snipers
- Hidden throughout upper section
- Inflict toxic status
- Don't respawn when killed
- Priority targets

### Giant Mosquitoes
- Spawn infinitely in swamp
- Annoying but weak
- Drop Large Titanite Shards rarely

## Boss: Chaos Witch Quelaag

Located in a webbed mound at the swamp's edge:

### Appearance
- Upper body of a woman
- Fused to massive lava spider
- Wields Furysword

### Attacks
- Lava puddle AOE attacks
- Explosive blast
- Sword swipes
- Lava projectiles

### Strategy
- Stay close to avoid AOE
- Watch for explosion tell
- Summon Maneater Mildred for help
- Fire resistance helpful

## Important NPCs

### Quelana of Izalith
- Appears after defeating Quelaag (requires 10+ Intelligence)
- Teaches advanced pyromancies
- Daughter of the Witch of Izalith

### The Fair Lady
- Quelaag's sister, found after boss fight
- Leader of Chaos Servant covenant
- Tragically ill from absorbing Blighttown's plague
- Cannot understand player without Old Witch's Ring

### Eingyi

## Hidden Areas

### The Great Hollow
- Hidden behind illusory walls
- Leads to Ash Lake
- Contains Crystal Lizards
- Treacherous root platforming

### Valley of Drakes Connection
- Provides shortcut from Firelink
- Requires Master Key or alternate route
- Skips most of upper Blighttown

## Notable Items

- **Shadow Set**: Ninja armor with high poison resist
- **Power Within**: Powerful pyromancy buff
- **Eagle Shield**: High stability greatshield
- **Crimson Set**: In swamp, guarded by Blowdart Sniper

## Lore Significance

Blighttown tells a tragic tale of the Chaos Witches:
- Quelaag and her sister fled here after Chaos birth
- The Fair Lady tried to cure the plague
- She absorbed the sickness into herself
- Quelaag kills humans to ease her sister's pain

## Survival Tips

### Preparation
- Stock Purple and Blooming Purple Moss
- Equip high poison resistance gear
- Bring ranged options for Mosquitoes
- Consider Rusted Iron Ring for swamp

### Navigation
- Kill Blowdart Snipers permanently
- Light both bonfires ASAP
- Use ladders carefully
- Watch for ambushes

### Swamp Strategy
- Accept poison, manage health
- Clear path before collecting items
- Use bonfire near Quelaag's Domain
- Explore edges for treasures

## Community Reception

Blighttown's reputation stems from:
- Technical issues in original release
- Challenging vertical design
- Toxic dart snipers
- Slow swamp navigation
- General atmosphere of misery

Despite frustrations, many consider conquering Blighttown a rite of passage that separates casual players from those committed to the Dark Souls experience.
