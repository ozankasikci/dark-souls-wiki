# Undead Burg

> *"A fortified town surrounded by large walls and watchtowers, filled with hostile undead."*

The Undead Burg serves as the first major test for new players, teaching core Dark Souls mechanics without tutorial messages. This fortified settlement is divided into upper and lower sections, each presenting unique challenges.

## Overview

After leaving the relative safety of Firelink Shrine, the Undead Burg presents players with their first real combat scenarios. The area masterfully introduces concepts like:
- Ambushes and enemy placement
- Environmental hazards
- Alternative paths and shortcuts
- Boss encounters

## Upper Undead Burg

The upper section consists of three main areas leading to the Taurus Demon:

### Entry Bridge
- Initial encounter with Hollow Warriors
- Introduction to ranged combat via Hollow Archers
- Hidden merchant location below

### Town Square
- Multiple ambush points
- Rooftop traversal sections
- Black Knight encounter (optional)
- Valuable items hidden in side paths

### Boss Approach
- Narrow bridge with archer coverage
- Ladder to upper platform (crucial for boss strategy)
- Fog gate leading to Taurus Demon

## Lower Undead Burg

Accessed later with the Residence Key:
- More aggressive Hollow Thieves
- Tighter corridors and ambush points
- Path to Capra Demon
- Connection to the Depths

## Boss: Taurus Demon

This minotaur-like demon serves as the first major boss for most players:

### Appearance
- Large, fur-covered demon
- Wields massive Demon's Greataxe
- Positioned on narrow bridge

### Strategy
- Climb tower ladder before engaging
- Plunging attacks deal massive damage
- Gold Pine Resin (found earlier) provides advantage
- Can jump to tower if player camps there
- Optional boss - can be skipped with Master Key

## Notable NPCs

### Solaire of Astora
Found after defeating Taurus Demon:
- Provides White Sign Soapstone
- Teaches "Praise the Sun" gesture
- Available for summoning at various bosses

### Undead Merchant (Male)
Hidden in building near first bonfire:
- Sells essential items
- Provides Residence Key
- Drops Uchigatana if killed

## Key Items and Secrets

- **Gold Pine Resin**: Lightning buff perfect for Taurus Demon
- **Black Knight Sword**: Rare drop from optional Black Knight
- **Drake Sword**: Obtained by shooting Hellkite Dragon's tail
- **Humanity**: Hidden in various corpses

## Environmental Hazards

### Hellkite Dragon Bridge
- Dragon breathes fire across bridge
- Can be triggered and avoided
- Safe spot exists in middle stairway
- Drake Sword obtainable from below

### Firebomb Hollows
- Positioned on elevated platforms
- Can knock players off ledges
- Priority targets in combat

## Connections

- **Firelink Shrine**: Via aqueduct
- **Undead Parish**: Across dragon bridge
- **Lower Undead Burg**: Locked door (requires key)
- **Darkroot Basin**: Through Havel (Master Key required)

## Level Design

The Undead Burg exemplifies Dark Souls' level design philosophy:
- Vertical interconnection
- Shortcuts that loop back
- Risk/reward side paths
- Environmental storytelling

## Tips for New Players

- Take time to learn enemy patterns
- Check corners for ambushes
- Explore thoroughly for items
- Don't rush across dragon bridge
- Practice parrying on basic Hollows
- Firebombs are effective against groups

## Lore Significance

Once a thriving town, the Undead Burg fell to the curse like much of Lordran. Its residents became Hollow, forever guarding their posts in a mockery of their former lives. The presence of the Black Knight suggests this area holds significance in the larger conflict between Light and Dark.
