# Kiln of the First Flame

> *"The Kiln of the First Flame - where Lord Gwyn sacrificed himself to link the fire and prolong the Age of Fire."*

The Kiln of the First Flame is the final area in Dark Souls, an ash-covered wasteland where the First Flame still burns. Here, Lord Gwyn awaits those who would succeed or end his legacy.

## Access Requirements

To reach the Kiln, you must:
1. Acquire all four Lord Souls:
   - Soul of Seath the Scaleless (Duke's Archives)
   - Lord Soul from the Bed of Chaos (Lost Izalith)
   - Lord Soul from Gravelord Nito (Tomb of the Giants)
   - Lord Soul from the Four Kings (The Abyss)
2. Place all souls in the Lordvessel at Firelink Altar
3. The orange fog gate will lift, granting access

## Area Layout

### The Ashen Path
- Single bonfire at the entrance
- Long descent through ash-covered ruins
- Linear path with no branches
- Stone walkways and crumbling architecture
- No shortcuts or alternate routes

### Black Knight Gauntlet
Five Black Knights guard the path to Gwyn:
1. **Sword Knight**: First encounter
2. **Greatsword Knight**: Second encounter
3. **Sword Knight**: Third encounter
4. **Greataxe Knight**: Fourth encounter
5. **Halberd Knight**: Final guardian

Unlike Black Knights elsewhere in Lordran, these respawn upon resting at bonfires.

## Boss: Gwyn, Lord of Cinder

The final boss of Dark Souls - once the mightiest of the gods, now a hollow shell of his former self.

### Characteristics
- Aggressive melee combatant
- Wields a flaming greatsword
- Fast attack chains
- Vulnerable to parrying
- Somber piano music accompanies the battle

### Strategy
- Parrying is the most effective approach
- Black Knight Shield has excellent fire defense
- Keep medium distance to bait punishable attacks
- Avoid getting cornered in the arena
- Can summon Solaire if his questline was completed properly

### Rewards
- Soul of Gwyn, Lord of Cinder (can be used for boss weapons)
- Access to either ending

## Endings

After defeating Gwyn, two choices are presented:

### Link the Fire
- Touch the bonfire to link the fire
- Continue the Age of Fire
- Your character becomes kindling for the flame
- Standard ending achievement

### Dark Lord
- Walk away from the bonfire
- Usher in the Age of Dark
- Become the Dark Lord of humanity
- Alternative ending achievement

## Notable Loot

### Black Knight Equipment
Each Black Knight can drop their respective weapon:
- Black Knight Sword
- Black Knight Greatsword
- Black Knight Greataxe
- Black Knight Halberd
- Black Knight Shield (any knight)

### Black Knight Armor Set
Found on a corpse along the path:
- Black Knight Helm
- Black Knight Armor
- Black Knight Gauntlets
- Black Knight Leggings

### Titanite Chunks
The Black Knights drop various titanite chunks:
- Regular Titanite Chunks
- Red Titanite Chunks
- Blue Titanite Chunks
- White Titanite Chunks

This makes the Kiln an excellent farming location for upgrade materials.

## Combat Strategy

### Dealing with Black Knights
- Can be parried for critical hits
- Susceptible to backstabs
- High poise - stagger with heavy weapons
- Each has different attack patterns based on weapon
- Can run past all of them to reach Gwyn

### Recommended Preparation
- Bring a stability shield for blocking
- Lightning weapons deal good damage
- Hornet Ring boosts parry damage
- Full Estus Flask (kindled bonfire)

## Lore Significance

### The First Linking
When the First Flame began to fade, Lord Gwyn journeyed to the Kiln with his most loyal knights. He sacrificed himself as kindling, prolonging the Age of Fire but beginning the Undead Curse.

### The Black Knights' Fate
The Silver Knights who accompanied Gwyn were incinerated when he linked the fire, their armor burned black. They became disembodied spirits, cursed to wander Lordran for eternity.

### The Cycle
The Chosen Undead's arrival at the Kiln represents the culmination of the prophecy - either continuing Gwyn's legacy by linking the fire, or ending the cycle entirely.

## Tips

- The Black Knights here are excellent for farming their rare equipment
- Stock up on Homeward Bones to quickly exit after farming
- The bonfire is close to a warp point for convenience
- Practice parrying on the knights before facing Gwyn
- Solaire's summon sign appears near the fog gate if he survived

## Atmosphere

The Kiln presents a stark, haunting finale:
- Ash covers everything, remnants of countless linkings
- Ruined architecture hints at an ancient civilization
- The sky is perpetually overcast
- Gwyn's piano theme creates an emotional, melancholic mood
- The area's simplicity contrasts with earlier complex areas

## New Game Plus

After either ending, the game transitions to NG+:
- All non-key items carry over
- Enemies have increased health and damage
- Lord Souls must be collected again
- Different covenant requirements
- Additional ring variants available
