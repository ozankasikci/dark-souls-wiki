# Northern Undead Asylum

## Overview
The Northern Undead Asylum is where the Chosen Undead begins their pilgrimage. This massive prison was built to contain those afflicted with the Darksign, where they are meant to remain until the end of the world. It serves as both the game's tutorial area and an important location that can be revisited later.

## Layout
The asylum consists of multiple levels connected by stairs and corridors. The main courtyard houses the first boss encounter, while prison cells line the upper floors. A hidden bonfire provides respite before the final confrontation.

## First Visit
During your initial escape, you'll learn the game's basic mechanics through helpful orange soapstone messages. Oscar of Astora, an Elite Knight, drops the key to your cell and provides your first Estus Flask before his tragic demise.

## Boss: Asylum Demon
This massive demon wields a huge hammer and guards the exit. Players first encounter it in a scripted battle where fleeing is the intended option, before facing it properly with full equipment.

## Return Visit
Players can return to the asylum later via the giant crow at Firelink Shrine. The revisit features:
- Stray Demon boss fight
- Rusted Iron Ring
- Peculiar Doll (key to Painted World)
- Additional hollows including torch-wielding variants

## Lore
The asylum represents the fate of the Undead - imprisonment and eventual hollowing. Its remote northern location ensures the Undead remain forgotten by the world. The presence of demons suggests a connection to the chaos that has infected even this distant prison.

## Strategy Tips
- Don't fight the Asylum Demon on first encounter
- Plunging attacks deal massive damage to the boss
- Black Firebombs can make the fight trivial
- The revisit is much more dangerous than the initial visit
