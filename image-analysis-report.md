# Dark Souls Wiki - Image Analysis Report

## Summary
After comparing all data files in `/data` with images in `/assets/images`, I found that **all 97 data files have corresponding images** (100% coverage). However, there are some organizational issues that should be addressed.

## Key Findings

### 1. **No Missing Images**
Every markdown data file has a corresponding image file:
- **Areas**: 23/23 ✓
- **Bosses**: 19/19 ✓
- **NPCs**: 19/19 ✓
- **Items**: 6/6 ✓
- **Weapons**: 18/18 ✓
- **Armor**: 1/1 ✓
- **Shields**: 1/1 ✓
- **Rings**: 1/1 ✓
- **Catalysts**: 1/1 ✓
- **Builds**: 1/1 ✓
- **Quests**: 3/3 ✓
- **Lore**: 4/4 ✓

### 2. **Duplicate Data Files Found**
In the NPCs directory, there are duplicate entries:
- `ludleth.md` and `ludleth-of-courland.md` (both have corresponding images)
- `patches.md` and `patches-ds1.md` (both have corresponding images)

### 3. **Orphaned Images**
Images that exist but have no corresponding data file:
- `npcs/solaire.jpg` (there is `solaire-of-astora.md` but no `solaire.md`)

### 4. **Cross-Category Images**
Some equipment items have their images stored in the items folder instead of their category folder:
- `elite-knight-set` - Data in `equipment/armor/` but image in `items/`
- `ring-of-favor` - Data in `equipment/rings/` but image in `items/`

## Recommendations

1. **Remove duplicate data files** or merge their content:
   - Decide between `ludleth.md` vs `ludleth-of-courland.md`
   - Decide between `patches.md` vs `patches-ds1.md`

2. **Clean up orphaned images**:
   - Remove `npcs/solaire.jpg` or create a `solaire.md` data file

3. **Standardize image locations**:
   - Move equipment images to their appropriate category folders
   - Or update the content renderer to check multiple locations

4. **Image format consistency**:
   - Most images use `.jpg` format
   - Some use `.png` (items, catalysts, shields, weapons)
   - Some use `.svg` (builds, lore, quests, some items/weapons)
   - Consider standardizing formats by category

## Conclusion
The wiki has excellent image coverage with no missing images. The main issues are organizational rather than content-related. Addressing the duplicate files and standardizing image locations will improve maintainability.
