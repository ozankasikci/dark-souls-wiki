Generated on: 2025-06-21

## Summary
The website has significant image loading issues with many missing images across all sections.

## Key Findings

### 1. Equipment Section
- **Working Images**: Most weapon images are loading correctly (e.g., black-knight-sword.png, claymore.png, longsword.png)
- **Missing Images**:
  - `friede's-great-scythe` (tried .png, .jpg, .jpeg, .svg)
  - `gael's-greatsword` (tried .png, .jpg, .jpeg, .svg)
  - `elite-knight-set.png` (only .jpg version exists)

### 2. Bosses Section
- Limited boss images visible in the list view
- The system attempted to load boss images but many returned 404 errors

### 3. Areas Section
- No area images are loading (all 404 errors)
- Missing images for locations like:
  - archdragon-peak.jpg
  - cathedral-of-the-deep.jpg
  - crystal-cave.jpg
  - And many others

### 4. NPCs Section
- Most NPC images are missing (404 errors)
- The image loader tries multiple formats (.png, .jpg, .jpeg, .svg) as fallback

## Technical Details

### Image Loading Strategy
The website uses an intelligent image loader that:
1. Attempts to load the primary format
2. Falls back to alternative formats if the primary fails
3. Tries formats in this order: original → .jpg → .jpeg → .svg → .png

### Console Errors
- Over 100 "Failed to load resource" errors detected
- All are 404 (File not found) errors
- The errors don't break the site functionality but result in missing visuals

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Run the image download scripts to populate missing images
   - Verify the `assets/images/` directory structure matches expected paths
   - Check file naming conventions (some use hyphens vs underscores)

2. **File Naming Issues**:
   - `friede's-great-scythe` vs `friede-scythe` (inconsistent naming)
   - Some files expect .png but only .jpg versions exist

3. **Missing Directories**:
   - Ensure these directories exist with proper images:
     - `/assets/images/areas/`
     - `/assets/images/bosses/`
     - `/assets/images/npcs/`
     - `/assets/images/armor/`

## Successful Image Loads
The following images loaded successfully:
- Most weapon images in `/assets/images/weapons/`
- `elite-knight-set.jpg` (armor)
- `ring-of-favor.png`
- `grass-crest-shield.png`
- `pyromancy-flame.png`

## Next Steps
1. Use the existing image download scripts in the `/scripts/` directory
2. Verify all image paths match the expected format in the markdown files
3. Consider implementing placeholder images for missing assets
