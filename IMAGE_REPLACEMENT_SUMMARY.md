## Scripts Created
1. `batch-download-images-v2.js` - Alpha Coders image downloader
2. `download-images-direct.js` - WallpaperCave direct URL downloader
3. `download-remaining-images.js` - Alternative ID downloader

- ✅ Key boss images (Nameless King, Soul of Cinder, Sister Friede, etc.)
- ✅ Important NPC images (Fire Keeper, Siegward, Patches, etc.)
- ✅ Some item images (Elite Knight Set, Ring of Favor, weapons)

## Remaining Work
The following images still need replacement:
- Some area images (Anor Londo, Depths, Darkroot Basin/Garden, etc.)
- Several boss images (Lothric, Vordt, Demon Prince, etc.)
- Some NPC images (Solaire, Cornyx, Rosaria, etc.)

## Recommendations
1. The remaining 53 placeholder images could be sourced from:
   - Official game wikis (Fextralife, Wikidot)
   - Steam community screenshots
   - Manual screenshots from gameplay
   - Alternative wallpaper sites

2. Consider creating a manual mapping for the hardest-to-find images

3. The site is now significantly more visually appealing with ~55% of placeholder images replaced with high-quality artwork
