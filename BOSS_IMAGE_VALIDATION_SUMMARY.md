## Scripts Created
1. **delete-incorrect-images.js** - Deleted 8 incorrect boss images
2. **download-dark-souls-boss-images.js** - Script to download correct boss images

## Recommendations
1. The placeholder URLs in the download script should be replaced with actual Dark Souls boss images from:
   - Official game wikis (Fextralife, Wikidot) with proper attribution
   - Steam community screenshots
   - Personal gameplay screenshots
   - Official promotional material

2. Each image should be verified before use to ensure it shows the correct boss

3. Consider using a consistent art style across all boss images (either all screenshots or all artwork)

## Impact
- Removed 8 completely incorrect images that were misleading users
- Identified 15 missing boss images that need proper replacements
- Maintained 6 correct boss images that were already in place

The wiki's boss section now needs proper Dark Souls boss images to replace the deleted incorrect ones and fill in the missing ones.
